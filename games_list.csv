It is based on the 2005 FIA Historic Racing Championships for GTC and TC cars of the 1960s and 1970s. This is a modern-day championship for historic cars, and so the circuit designs in GT Legends are those of the modern era, contrasting with games such as Grand Prix Legends which are actually set in historic times.

GT Legends has the same graphics engine as rFactor (developed by Image Space Incorporated), a similar physics engine but different multiplayer code.

Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel ;Action RPG;03/14/01;Micro Forté ;14 Degrees East ;"Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, better known as simply Fallout Tactics, is a turn-based/real-time tactical role-playing game     based in the post-apocalyptic Fallout universe.

Developed by Micro Forté and published by 14 Degrees East, Fallout Tactics was released on 14 March 2001 for PC. The game follows a squad in the fictional Brotherhood of Steel as it becomes engaged in a desperate war. Although the game takes place in the Fallout universe, it does not follow or continue the story of either Fallout or Fallout 2. Due to contradictions with the story and setting of those games, original Fallout creators and initially the creators of Fallout 3 considered Fallout Tactics non-canon . With the release of Fallout 3 by the new developing team Bethesda Softworks, however, the existence of the game's Brotherhood splinter faction is considered at least semi-canon, with Brotherhood of Steel members in-game explaining that the Chicago-based Brotherhood featured in Fallout Tactics ""...went rogue. Long story.""

Fallout Tactics shipped with a bonus CD when it was pre-ordered. The bonus CD included Fallout: Warfare, a table-top miniatures game based on the Fallout universe, as well as a bonus mission for the main game which occurs in Springfield.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Fallout_Tactics_Box.jpg/256px-Fallout_Tactics_Box.jpg;PC;http://www.interplay.com/falloutbos/;M

It is the fourth installment in The Elder Scrolls action fantasy video game series, following The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Oblivion was first released in March 2006 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. A PlayStation 3 (PS3) version shipped in March 2007 in North America, and in April 2007 in Europe and Australia. After a number of smaller content releases, a major expansion pack, Shivering Isles, was distributed. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of the Year Edition (a package including both Shivering Isles and the official plug-in Knights of the Nine) was released in September 2007 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, and on Steam in June 2009. A fifth anniversary edition was shipped in North America in July 2011 and in Australia in September 2011. Versions for other regions have been confirmed, although release details are unannounced.

Oblivion's main story revolves around the player character's efforts to thwart a fanatical cult known as the ""Mythic Dawn"" that plans to open the gates to a realm called ""Oblivion"". The game continues the open-world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely. A perpetual objective for players is to improve their character's skills, which are numerical representations of certain abilities. Seven skills are selected early in the game as major skills, with the remainder termed minor. Developers opted for tighter pacing in gameplay and greater plot focus than in past titles.

Development for Oblivion began in 2002, directly after the release of Morrowind. To achieve its goals of designing ""cutting-edge graphics"", Bethesda used an improved Havok physics engine, high dynamic range lighting, procedural content generation tools that allowed developers to quickly create detailed terrains, and the Radiant A.I. system, which enabled non-player characters (NPCs) to make choices and engage in behaviors more complex than in past titles. The game was developed with fully voiced characters—a first for the series—and features the music of BAFTA-award-winning composer Jeremy Soule. Oblivion was well received and has won a number of industry and publication awards. It was praised for its impressive graphics, expansive game world and schedule-driven NPCs. The game had shipped 1.7 million copies by April 2006, and sold over 3 million copies by January 2007.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4b/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_cover.png/256px-The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_cover.png;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://www.elderscrolls.com/oblivion/;M

In the single-player campaign, the player assumes the role of hero Sam ""Serious"" Stone in his adventures against the forces of the extraterrestrial overlord, ""Mental"", who seeks to destroy humanity. Taking place after the events of Serious Sam: The Second Encounter, Sam travels through various worlds collecting parts of a medallion in an effort to defeat Mental.

The multiplayer mode includes online co-op and deathmatch, the latter having been introduced in a patch.  A 4.5/5.0 was awarded to Serious Sam by Computer Gaming World, though overall the game received moderate praise from the media, earning an average of 75% on Game Rankings.  

Croteam simultaneously developed Serious Engine 2, the successor to their previous game engine, Serious Engine, for use in the game, and the engine is capable of many features of other advanced game engines of the time including high dynamic range rendering and light bloom.

If the game's clock runs out (by default in the year 2050 AD) with none of these goals fulfilled by any nation, the nation with the highest score is declared the winner.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7e/CivIVboxshot.jpg;PC;http://www.2kgames.com/civ4/;E

It is the latest game in the Civilization series.

In Civilization V, the player leads a civilization from prehistoric times into the future on a procedurally-generated map, achieving one of a number of different victory conditions through research, diplomacy, expansion, economic development, government and military conquest. The game is based on an entirely new game engine with hexagonal tiles instead of the square tiles of earlier games in the series.  Many elements from Civilization IV and its expansion packs have been removed or changed, such as religion and espionage. The combat system has been overhauled, removing stacking of military units and enabling cities to defend themselves by firing directly on nearby enemies.  In addition, the maps contain computer-controlled city-states as non-player characters that are available for trade, diplomacy and conquest. A civilization's borders also expand one tile at a time, favoring more productive tiles,  and roads now have a maintenance cost, making them much less common. 

The game features community, modding, and multiplayer elements. 

An expansion pack, Civilization V: Gods & Kings, has been announced for a late Spring 2012 release and will include such past features as religions and espionage as well as 9 new civilizations.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/CIVILIZATION-V-FRONT-OF-BOX.jpg;PC;http://www.civilization5.com/;E

BioShock: Infinite ;First Person Shooter (FPS);10/16/12;Irrational Games;2K Games;"BioShock Infinite is an upcoming first-person shooter video game, and the third game in the BioShock series. Previously known as ""Project Icarus"", it is being developed by Irrational Games for an October 2012 release on the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. BioShock Infinite is not a direct sequel or prequel to previous BioShock games, taking place in an earlier period and different setting, though it features similar gameplay concepts and themes.

Building on the ideas of American Exceptionalism in the early 20th century, the game's protagonist, former Pinkerton agent, Booker DeWitt, is sent in 1912 to the floating air-city of Columbia to seek out a young woman, Elizabeth, who has been held captive there for the last twelve years. Though Booker rescues Elizabeth easily, the two are pursued by warring factions on the collapsing city: the Founders that strive to keep the city for pure American citizens, and the Vox Populi, a hodgepodge group of several smaller factions trying to seize control from the Founders. Booker finds Elizabeth to be central to this conflict, and that she also holds strange powers to manipulate rifts in the time-space continuum that ravage Columbia. Ken Levine, the lead designer for the game, took inspiration for the story and setting from both historical pieces at the turn of the 19th century, as well as more recent events including the ""Occupy"" protests. Levine took an unorthodox approach with the voice actors for Booker and Elizabeth, Troy Baker and Courtnee Draper, respectively, by developing the script and details of the story alongside them during their voice work, allowing them to help define the characters and deliver more convincing performances within the game.

The player controls Booker throughout the game, eventually teaming with the computer-controlled Elizabeth. Like previous BioShock games, the player uses a combination of weapons, psychokinetic powers granted through ""vigors"" and ""nostrums"", and Elizabeth's own powers to fight off hostile foes and make their way through Columbia. In contrast to the limited spaces of the underwater city of Rapture, the open-air city of Columbia provides for more combat challenges, including combat that takes place aboard the city's Skyline rollercoaster-like rail system. The game will also feature a ""1999 Mode"", harkening back to games like System Shock 2 where decisions made by the player will have a more permanent impact on the game, possibly leading the player to an unwinnable situation and requiring a restart from an earlier saved game.

BioShock Infinite has received early pre-release attention, winning several awards including the ""Best of Show"" at the 2011 E3 show.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/06/Bioshock-infinite-logo.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://www.bioshockgame.com/;M

The game was initially released in North America and Europe on 11 July 2006. Prey uses a heavily modified version of id Tech 4 to use portals and variable gravity to create the environments the player explores.

The game's story is focused on Cherokee Domasi ""Tommy"" Tawodi as he, his girlfriend, and grandfather are abducted aboard an alien spaceship known as The Sphere as it consumes material, both inanimate and living, from Earth in order to sustain itself. Tommy's Cherokee past allows him to let his spirit roam freely at times, and gives Tommy an edge in his attempt to stop the Sphere.

Prey had been in development in one form or another since 1995, and has had several major revisions. While the general approach to gameplay, including the use of portals, remained in the game, the story and setting changed several times. The game received generally positive reviews and was a commercial success, selling more than one million copies in the first two months of its release  and leading to the development of a sequel, with rights owned by the Radar Group.

The game was published by Activision and RedOctane, and is the first game in the series to be developed by Neversoft, after Activision's acquisition of RedOctane and MTV Games' purchase of Harmonix Music Systems, the previous development studio for the series. The game was released worldwide for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 in October 2007, with Budcat Creations and Vicarious Visions assisting in the PlayStation 2 and Wii ports, respectively. Aspyr Media developed the PC and Mac versions of the game, releasing them later in 2007.

Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock retains the basic gameplay from previous games in the Guitar Hero series, where the player uses a guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of lead, bass, and rhythm guitar parts in rock songs by playing in time to scrolling notes on-screen. The game, in addition to existing single-player Career modes, includes a new Co-Op Career mode and competitive challenges that pit the player against in-game characters and other players. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the first game in the series to include an online multiplayer feature, which is enabled in the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii versions. Initially the game offers over 70 songs, most of which are master tracks. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions feature the ability to download additional songs. The musicians Tom Morello (of the bands Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave) and Slash (of Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver) make appearances both as guitar battle opponents and playable characters in the game. The PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 versions also include Bret Michaels (of Poison) as a non-playable character.

Critics were generally favorable towards the game, but reviewers noted a difference in the game's style compared to previous installments, associating it with it being Neversoft's first development attempt with the series. The game is often cited to be too difficult, creating ""walls of notes""  that are difficult to complete, and led to alterations in note placement for future games in the series were designed. According to Activision, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the best-selling video game of 2007, both in terms of units sold and revenue earned, and that it is the first single retail video game to exceed one billion dollars in sales. The company also claimed that it is the second-best selling video game title since 1995, following Wii Play, and is one of the best-selling third-party games available for the Wii.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/Guitar-hero-iii-cover-image.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360, Wii;http://www.guitarherogame.com/gh3/;T

While originally thought to be canonical to the Ultimate Spider-Man comics, it is unclear what parts of the game take place in the continuity of the comic.

The game revolves around an artifact known as the Tablet of Order and Chaos. When it is shattered into pieces during a skirmish between Spider-Man and Mysterio it causes problems with multiple Marvel Universe realities. Madame Web calls on four versions of Spider-Man from four realities to assist her in bringing the realities back into balance: the Amazing Spider-Man; Spider-Man Noir, a 1930s version of Spider-Man; Spider-Man 2099, the Spider-Man of a possible future; and Ultimate Spider-Man, the younger Spider-Man of an alternate present who is currently bonded with a symbiote.

Shattered Dimensions received fairly positive reviews from critics, with reported aggregate scores averaging 74% or higher at GameRankings, and Metacritic reporting scores of 76 out of 100. Reviewers generally praised the idea of bringing four Marvel universes together, and lauded the voice acting. The game's story was received to mixed thoughts, with some reviewers enjoying the link between the four universes, and others stating there was not enough depth to carry the game.

Doom 3 ;First Person Shooter (FPS);08/03/04;id Software;Activision Blizzard;"Doom 3 is a science fiction horror video game developed by id Software and published by Activision. An example of the first-person shooter genre, Doom 3 was first released for Microsoft Windows on August 3, 2004.  The game was later adapted for Linux, as well as being ported by Aspyr Media for Mac OS X. Developer Vicarious Visions ported the game to the Xbox console, releasing it on April 3, 2005. British developers Splash Damage also assisted in design for the multiplayer elements of the game. 

The game is a reboot of the Doom franchise, disregarding the storylines of the previous Doom video games. Doom 3 is set in 2145 on Mars, where a military-industrial conglomerate has set up a scientific research facility to develop fields such as teleportation, biological research and advanced weapons design. However, the teleportation experiments inadvertently open a gateway to Hell, resulting in a catastrophic invasion by demons. The player, an anonymous space marine, must fight through the base and find a way to stop demons from Hell attacking Earth.  Doom 3 features an award-winning game engine, id Tech 4, which has since been licensed out to other developers,  and later released under the GNU General Public License in November 2011.

The game was a critical and commercial success for id Software; with more than 3.5 million copies of the game sold, it is the most successful game by the developer to date.   Critics praised the game's graphics and presentation,  although reviewers were divided by how close the gameplay was to that of the original Doom, focusing primarily on simply fighting through large numbers of enemy characters.  The game was followed by Resurrection of Evil, an expansion pack developed by Nerve Software in April 2005, while a Doom film loosely based on the series was released in October 2005. A series of novelizations of Doom 3, written by Matthew J. Costello, debuted in February 2008.  The franchise is to continue with Doom 4.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4e/Doom3box.jpg/250px-Doom3box.jpg;PC;;M
Doom ;First Person Shooter (FPS);12/10/93;id Software;Activision Blizzard;"Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents)  is a 1993 first-person shooter video game by id Software. It is widely recognized for having popularized the first person shooter genre, pioneering immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as ""WADs"". Its graphic and interactive violence,  as well as its Satanic imagery, also made it the subject of considerable controversy. In Doom, players assume the role of a space marine who must fight his way through a military base on Mars' moon, Phobos, and kill the demons from Hell.

With one third of the game (9 levels) distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 10 million people within two years of its release, popularizing the mode of gameplay and spawning a gaming subculture; as a sign of its effect on the industry, games from the mid-1990s boom of first-person shooters are often known simply as ""Doom clones"". According to GameSpy, Doom was voted by industry insiders to be the greatest game of all time in 2004.  The game was made available on Steam on August 3, 2007. 

The Doom franchise was continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including The Ultimate Doom (1995), Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for PC/DOS, the games have later been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making WADs, speedruns, and modifications to the original.

The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using new technology, and an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. On May 7, 2008, following speculation by John Carmack at QuakeCon on August 3, 2007, Doom 4 was announced as in production. The game is neither a sequel to Doom 3 nor a new beginning of the franchise and it will use the company's new id Tech 5 engine. On June 26, 2009, John Carmack released Doom Resurrection, a new game developed by Escalation Studios for iOS and published by id Software. The setting for Doom Resurrection takes place parallel to Doom 3, and it uses characters and art from it.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/Doom_cover_art.jpg;PC;http://www.idsoftware.com/games/doom/doom-ultimate/;M

Master Levels for Doom II, an expansion pack that includes 21 new levels, was released on December 26, 1995 by id Software. 

Due to its popularity and success, Doom II has been released for numerous platforms, including the Amiga, Apple Macintosh, Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Nintendo Game Boy Advance. The release of the original Doom source code has facilitated ports to many other platforms, including the Apple iPod, and several types of cellphones.

Call of Duty 2 ;First Person Shooter (FPS);10/25/05;Infinity Ward;Activision Blizzard;"Call of Duty 2 is a first-person shooter (FPS) video game and the second installment in the critically acclaimed Call of Duty series. It was developed by Infinity Ward and published by Konami in Japan and Activision in the rest of the world. The game was released on October 25, 2005 for Microsoft Windows PCs and on November 22, 2005 as a launch game for the Xbox 360 in Europe, Australia and North America, and later in Japan. Other versions were released on other platforms, including mobile phones as well as Pocket PCs.

The game is set during World War II and the campaign mode is experienced through the perspectives of four soldiers: one in the Red Army, one in the United States Army, and two in the British Army. It contains four individual campaigns, split into three stories, with a total of twenty-seven missions. Activision officially announced the game on April 7, 2005 in a press release. Many things were added and changed from the original Call of Duty. The most notable change is the regenerating health, similar to the original Halo trilogy of games. Additions include an icon that indicates a nearby grenade about to explode.

The game was met with a positive public reception, where critics praised the game particularly for the graphics, sound and the regenerating health system. The Xbox 360 version sold over 250,000 copies in its first week, and had sold 2 million copies by January 2008. There was some controversy over the game's advertisement, where the commercial depicted a first-person view of events that were supposed to transpire during the game, rather than scenes from the game itself, making some consumers feel that the advertisements were misleading.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d1/Call_of_Duty_2_Box.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://callofduty.com/;M
Call of Duty ;First Person Shooter (FPS);10/29/03;Infinity Ward;Activision Blizzard;"Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision in 2003.  It is the first game in a series with the same name. The game simulates the infantry and combined arms warfare of World War II. The game is based on the Quake III: Team Arena engine. It was accompanied in September 2004 by an expansion pack, Call of Duty: United Offensive, which was produced by Activision, and developed by Gray Matter Interactive, with contributions from Pi Studios. Call of Duty is similar in theme and gameplay to Medal of Honor, as it is made out of single-player campaigns and missions. However, unlike Medal of Honor, the war is seen not just from the viewpoint of an American soldier but also from the viewpoint of British and Soviet soldiers.

The game was somewhat unusual at the time in that throughout the single-player mode the player is joined by computer-controlled allies who range in quantity from two infantrymen (in some of the British missions) to an entire regiment of tanks (in the Soviet missions). The computer-controlled allies will support the actual player during the missions. They also further the game's goal of providing an immersive and realistic experience; that is, soldiers in World War II were usually part of a larger group, as opposed to the ""lone wolf"" seen in video games such as Medal of Honor. However, there are some missions where the player is alone.

The ""Hardened"" and ""Prestige"" editions of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, released on November 10, 2009, includes a redemption code to download the game onto Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 hard drives, retitling it as Call of Duty Classic";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/Codbox.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://callofduty.com/;M

Quake 4 went gold in early October 2005 and was released on 18 October 2005 for Microsoft Windows and later for Linux, Xbox 360 and Mac OS X. A special DVD Collectors Edition also exists, including promotional material and the game Quake II with its expansions, The Reckoning and Ground Zero. The Xbox 360 version of Quake 4 is based on the Special Collectors Edition, and therefore also includes Quake II. On 4 August 2011 the game was made available through Steam.

Plotwise, the game is a sequel to Quake II and takes place during the same war as Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. Quake II, Quake 4, or Enemy Territory: Quake Wars do not share story lines with Quake or Quake III Arena; their only relation is their names and logos. Compared to other titles in the Quake series, Quake 4 has an increased emphasis on the single-player portion of the game.  A multiplayer mode is available, but it does not involve playable bots like Quake III Arena, without 3rd party modifications.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Quake4box.jpg/256px-Quake4box.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://www.ravensoft.com/gamesdetail.aspx?xmmid=624&xmid=21&xmview=2;M

Neverwinter Nights 2 ;Role Playing Game (RPG);10/31/06;Obsidian Entertainment ;Atari;"Neverwinter Nights 2 (also known as NWN2) is a role-playing video game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Atari. It is the sequel to BioWare's Neverwinter Nights, based on the Dungeons & Dragons pencil and paper fantasy role-playing game. Neverwinter Nights 2 utilizes an adaptation of the Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition rules.

Players create player characters to represent them during the game, using the same character creation rules as found in the Dungeons & Dragons game. They may gain the assistance of additional party members, and they eventually acquire a keep that can be used as a base of operations. Neverwinter Nights 2 is set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting—in and around the city of Neverwinter. The story is mostly unrelated to Neverwinter Nights and follows the journey of an orphaned adventurer investigating a group of mysterious artifacts known as ""silver shards"" and their connection to an ancient, evil spirit known as the King of Shadows.

Neverwinter Nights 2 went into development in July, 2004. This sequel was designed with the Aurora Engine, also used by its predecessor, and the game's toolset was included in the game's release for players to use in designing their own adventures. The game's design team drew upon older role-playing video games, and decided that the player character would have to earn the respect of others by the things the character does. The game was also designed to be playable with other players online, if they play together from the beginning of the storyline. The game was released in October and November 2006.

Reviews of Neverwinter Nights 2 were generally positive. Reviewers were pleased with the changes that had been made from the first game in the series, especially regarding the storyline and party management. The game won GameSpot's Best Story award for 2006. One of the most commonly raised complaints about the game was the presence of numerous technical glitches in its initial release. Two official expansions and one official adventure pack have been released for the game: Mask of the Betrayer in 2007, Storm of Zehir in 2008, and Mysteries of Westgate in 2009.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c7/Nwn2boxart.jpg;PC;http://www.nwn2.com/;T

The game was developed by Starbreeze Studios and published by Atari. According to Ian Stevens, Head of Production at Tigon Studios, the decision to do a remake was because Microsoft could not make the Xbox 360 backward compatible with Escape from Butcher Bay, and because they wanted to get the Escape story to a larger audience before progressing further. 

Dark Athena has improved graphics and AI from Butcher Bay along with the addition of a multiplayer mode. The single player mode has also been expanded to include Riddick escaping onto a mercenary ship called Dark Athena.

It was developed by The Collective, Inc. and published by Atari under license by Marc Ecko. There were two editions of the game, one being a limited edition and the other being the normal release.

The game focuses on an amateur graffiti artist known as Trane who uses graffiti and tagging as a way to protest against the corrupt Dystopic city of New Radius, in a future world where freedom of expression is suppressed by a tyrannical, Orwellian city government. The ""Contents Under Pressure"" title refers to the warning found on most aerosol spray paint cans.

The gameplay is set up like a non-linear fighting game; the story progresses in a linear fashion, without the player needing to complete side missions, as in Grand Theft Auto III, but a certain amount of freedom and open-endedness is available to the player as they complete ""Tag Wars"" in the first part of the game.

The musical score for the game was produced by underground hip hop artist RJD2.

A new fan-based title from Akella's pirate series called Sea Dogs: Return Of The Legend is available only in Russia and the CIS";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/SeaDogsBox.jpg/256px-SeaDogsBox.jpg;PC;http://www.akella.com/en/games/seadogs/;T

The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind ;Role Playing Game (RPG);05/01/02;Bethesda Softworks;Bethesda Softworks ;"The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is an action role-playing open world video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios, and published by Bethesda Softworks and Ubisoft. It is the third installment in The Elder Scrolls series of games, following The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, and preceding The Elder Scrolls IV:Oblivion. It was released in North America in 2002 for Microsoft Windows and the Xbox. Well-received publicly and critically, with over four million sales  and more than 60 awards (including Game of the Year),  the game spawned two expansion packs for the PC: Tribunal and Bloodmoon. Both were eventually repackaged into a full set containing all three, Morrowind: Game of the Year Edition, which shipped on October 30, 2003 for both PC and Xbox. 

The main story takes place on Vvardenfell, an island in the Dunmer province of Morrowind, which lies in the empire of Tamriel and is far from the more civilized lands to the west and south that typified Daggerfall and Arena. The central quests concern the deity Dagoth Ur, housed within the volcanic Red Mountain, who seeks to gain power and break Morrowind free from Imperial reign.    Morrowind was designed with an open-ended free-form style of gameplay in mind, with less of an emphasis on the game's main plot than its predecessors. This choice received mixed reviews in the gaming press, though such feelings were tempered by reviewers' appreciation of Morrowind's expansive and detailed game world.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/53/MorrowindCOVER.jpg/256px-MorrowindCOVER.jpg;PC, Xbox;http://www.elderscrolls.com/;T

Rogue Warrior ;First Person Shooter (FPS);12/01/09;Rebellion Developments ;Bethesda Softworks ;"Rogue Warrior (initially titled Rogue Warrior: Black Razor) is a first person shooter video game. It was developed by Rebellion Developments and published by Bethesda Softworks. The game was released November 26, 2009 in Australia, November 27, 2009 in Europe and December 1, 2009 in North America on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows platforms.   

In Rogue Warrior, the United States has sent in Richard Marcinko, a veteran Navy SEAL, on a mission into North Korea to disrupt ballistic missile launchers. As players progress, Marcinko will encounter numerous enemies and allies as he is sent from locations such as Korea, Russia, and others to pursue terrorists with dangerous missile capabilities. The plot is not based on the autobiography by the game's protagonist, Richard Marcinko.  Marcinko is voiced by actor Mickey Rourke.

The game was originally being developed by Zombie Studios, who was in early development stages of the game. Soon after, Bethesda stated that they weren't satisfied with the direction Zombie Studios was taking the game. Bethesda quickly scrapped the project and brought in Rebellion Development to develop an entire new game from scratch. Rebellion, while retaining some major elements from Zombie's rendition, has taken a whole new approach to the game and its focus.

The game received staggeringly poor reviews from video game critics, citing it as one of the worst games of the 2009 year due to its unresponsive controls, multiple glitches, extreme and incredibly frequent foul language, rushed production, uninteresting gameplay, short length, very limited multiplayer, as well as broken and/or exploited combat techniques that are offered in the game. It is ranked as the fourth worst rated video game of all time and the second worst on the Xbox 360 platform, according to GameRankings.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a5/Roguewarrior.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://www.roguewarrior.com/;M

Aquaria ;Action Adventure;12/07/07;Bit Blot;Bit Blot;"Aquaria is a 2D sidescrolling action-adventure computer game designed by Alec Holowka and Derek Yu, who together form the independent game company Bit Blot, which developed and originally published the game. After more than two years of development, the game was released in 2007 for Windows. A Macintosh port was released in 2008 by Ambrosia Software, and an updated version of the game was released on Steam that same year. A Linux version of the game was released as part of the Humble Indie Bundle collection in 2010, and a version for the iPad was released on November 2, 2011. In 2009, the Aquaria soundtrack album was made available for sale. It includes all of the music in the game as well as a new nine-minute vocal track and a few remixes.

The game follows Naija, a mermaid-like woman, as she explores the underwater world of Aquaria. Along her journey, she learns about both the history of the world and her own past. The gameplay focuses on a combination of swimming, singing and combat, through which Naija can interact with the world. Naija's songs can move items, affect plants and animals, and change her physical appearance into other forms. These forms have different abilities, such as firing projectiles at hostile creatures or passing through barriers inaccessible to her in her natural shape.

Reviews of the game were generally positive. Critics focused primarily on the visuals, music and atmosphere as particularly praiseworthy. Additional positive comments were made about the controls and gameplay, while critiques centered on the map system and a limited variety of objectives. The game won the Seumas McNally grand prize from the Independent Games Festival in March 2007.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/89/Aquaria_Logo.png;PC;http://www.bit-blot.com/aquaria;

Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast ;Role Playing Game (RPG);04/30/99;BioWare;Black Isle Studios;"Baldur's Gate is a role-playing video game developed by BioWare and released in 1998 by Interplay Entertainment. The game takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a high fantasy campaign setting, using a modified version of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) 2nd edition rules. The game received critical praise, and was credited (along with Diablo) with revitalizing the computer role-playing game (CRPG) genre.

The story follows the journey of the player-controlled protagonist around the Sword Coast region, which lies on the west coast of the continent Faerûn, as this character grows up and learns of his or her unusual origins following the cataclysmic Time of Troubles. Development of this player character (PC), and an accompanying party of diverse companions, occurs through interactive dialogue, exploration, and numerous battle skirmishes. The game provides rewards to the PC according to the morality of the choices made by the player.

Baldur's Gate uses the Bioware-developed Infinity Engine to create an isometric user interface to the game-world. The same engine was later used in games such as Planescape: Torment, the Icewind Dale series, the Baldur's Gate expansion pack Tales of the Sword Coast, the sequel Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, and the sequel's expansion pack Throne of Bhaal. The Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance series took its name from Baldur's Gate, but the storyline is unrelated and the games have little in common beyond the setting.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d0/Baldur%27s_Gate_box.PNG;PC;http://www.bioware.com/games/legacy;

The game is viewed from a 3/4 isometric camera angle (as is common in many third-person role-playing games, such as the Diablo series). It focuses on a protagonist, controlled by the player, as he travels on a quest that constitutes the central focus of the game. The plot stipulates a rift in reality that drastically altered medieval history by allowing demons and other similar beings to enter the mortal realm. During the game, the protagonist encounters and interacts with numerous historical figures such as Joan of Arc, who are represented as non-player characters.

Lionheart utilizes the SPECIAL role-playing system, which was first used in the Fallout series, and in this game functions primarily in adding points to specific skills in separate trees to strengthen a character's ""Spiritkind,"" which has a personality and nature chosen by the player at the start of the game.

Starcraft ;Real Time Strategy (RTS);04/01/98;Blizzard Entertainment ;Blizzard Entertainment ;"StarCraft is a military science fiction real-time strategy video game developed by Blizzard Entertainment. The first game of the StarCraft series was released for Microsoft Windows on 31 March 1998.  With more than 11 million copies sold worldwide as of February 2009, it is one of the best-selling games for the personal computer.  A Mac OS version was released in March 1999, and a Nintendo 64 adaptation co-developed with Mass Media Interactive Entertainment was released on 13 June 2000.  Work on the game started shortly after Warcraft II's release in 1995. StarCraft debuted at the 1996 E3, where it was unfavourably compared to Warcraft II; as a result, the project was entirely overhauled and then showcased to public in early 1997, receiving a far more positive response. StarCraft has had its storyline adapted and expanded through a series of novels, the expansion pack StarCraft: Brood War and two authorized add-ons. The game's sequel, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, was released in July 2010, with a further expansion pack, Starcraft II: Heart of the Swarm, expected in 2012. 

Set in the 26th century, the game revolves around three species fighting for dominance in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy known as the Koprulu Sector: the Terrans, humans exiled from Earth skilled at adapting to any situation; the Zerg, a race of insectoid aliens in pursuit of genetic perfection, obsessed with assimilating other races; and the Protoss, a humanoid species with advanced technology and psionic abilities, attempting to preserve their civilization and strict philosophical way of living from the Zerg. The game has been praised for pioneering the use of unique factions in real-time strategy gameplay  and for a compelling story. 

Many of the industry's journalists have praised StarCraft as one of the best  and most important  video games of all time, and for having raised the bar for developing real-time strategy games.  StarCraft's multiplayer is particularly popular in South Korea, where players and teams participate in professional competitions, earn sponsorships, and compete in televised tournaments.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/93/StarCraft_box_art.jpg/250px-StarCraft_box_art.jpg;PC;http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/sc/;T

Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos ;Real Time Strategy (RTS);07/03/02;Blizzard Entertainment ;Blizzard Entertainment ;"Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (often referred to as War3 or WC3 or RoC) is a real time strategy video game released by Blizzard Entertainment on July 3, 2002 (US). It is the second sequel to Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, and it is the third game set in the Warcraft Universe. An expansion pack, The Frozen Throne, was released on July 1, 2003 (US).

Warcraft III contains four playable races:  Humans and Orcs, which had previously appeared in Warcraft: Orcs & Humans and Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, and the Night Elves and Undead, which were introduced to the Warcraft mythos in this installment.  Warcraft III's single-player campaign is laid out similarly to that of StarCraft (another Blizzard game), being told through all four of the game's races in a progressive manner. In the expansion there are two additional races: the Draenei, a race of eredar who are cursed to be abominations, and the Naga, a race of vile serpents and other creatures that come from the depths of the sea. Multiplayer mode allows for play against other people, via the internet, instead of playing against computer-controlled characters as is done in the single-player custom game mode. Due to the dual storylines of the previous Warcraft games, the story can only be understood if using the proper storylines of one of the campaigns in the previous games, being the Orc Campaign on Warcraft: Orcs & Humans and the Human Campaigns on both the Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness and Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal.

The game proved to be a best seller and one of the most anticipated and popular computer game releases ever, with 4.5 million units shipped to retail stores and over one million units sold within a month.  Warcraft III won many awards including ""Game of the Year"" from more than six different publications.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/66/WarcraftIII.jpg/250px-WarcraftIII.jpg;PC;http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/war3/;T
Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness ;Real Time Strategy (RTS);11/30/95;Blizzard Entertainment ;Blizzard Entertainment ;"Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness is a fantasy-themed real-time strategy (RTS) game published by Blizzard Entertainment and first released for DOS in 1995 and for Mac OS in 1996. The main game, Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, earned enthusiastic reviews, won most of the major PC gaming awards in 1996, and sold over 2 million copies. 

Later in 1996 Blizzard released an expansion pack Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal for DOS and Mac OS, and a compilation Warcraft II: The Dark Saga for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The Battle.net Edition, released in 1999, provided Blizzard's online gaming service, Battle.net, and replaced the MS-DOS version with a Windows one.

Players must collect resources, and produce buildings and units in order to defeat an opponent in combat on the ground, in the air and in some maps at sea. The more advanced combat units are produced at the same buildings as the basic units but also need the assistance of other buildings, or must be produced at buildings that have prerequisite buildings. The majority of the main screen shows the part of the territory on which the gamer is currently operating, and the minimap can select another location to appear in the larger display. The fog of war completely hides all territory which the gamer's has not explored, and shows only terrain but hides opponents' units and buildings if none of the gamer's units are present.

Warcraft II 's predecessor Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, released in 1994, gained good reviews, collected three awards and was a finalist for three others, and achieved solid commercial success. The game was the first typical RTS to be presented in a medieval setting and, by bringing multiplayer facilities to a wider audience, made this mode essential for future RTS titles. Warcraft: Orcs & Humans laid the ground for Blizzard's style of RTS, which emphasized personality and storyline. Although Blizzard's very successful Starcraft, first released in 1998, was set in a different universe, it was very similar to Warcraft II in gameplay and in attention to personality and storyline. In 1996 Blizzard announced Warcraft Adventures, an adventure game in the Warcraft universe, but canceled the game in 1998. Warcraft III, released in 2002, used parts of Warcraft Adventures' characters and storyline and extended the gameplay used in Warcraft II.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/Warcraft-2-Tides-Of-Darkness-Pc.jpg/250px-Warcraft-2-Tides-Of-Darkness-Pc.jpg;PC;http://www.blizzard.com/war2bne/;T

Resident Evil 2 ;Survival horror;02/28/99;Capcom;Capcom;"Resident Evil 2, known as Biohazard 2 (バイオハザード2 Baiohazādo Tsū?) in Japan, is a survival horror video game originally released for the PlayStation in 1998. Developed by Capcom as the second installment in the Resident Evil series, its story takes place two months after the events of the first game, Resident Evil. It is set in Raccoon City, a Midwestern American mountain community whose residents have been transformed into zombies by the T-virus, a biological weapon developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. In their escape from the city, the two protagonists, Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, encounter other survivors, and are confronted by William Birkin, the mutated creator of the G-virus, a more powerful variation of the T-virus.

The gameplay of Resident Evil 2 focuses on exploration, puzzle solving and combat, and features typical survival horror elements such as limited saves and ammunition. The game's main difference from its predecessor is the ""Zapping System"", which provides each playable character with unique storylines and obstacles. Developed by a team of 40 to 50 people over the course of one year and nine months, Resident Evil 2 was directed by Hideki Kamiya and produced by Shinji Mikami. The initial version of the game, commonly referred to as Resident Evil 1.5, differed drastically from the released product and was scrapped at a development stage of 60–80 percent, after being deemed ""dull and boring"" by the producer. The resulting redesign introduced different settings and a more cinematic story presentation, supported by a soundtrack that employs ""desperation"" as an underlying theme.

Resident Evil 2 was well received by critics, who praised its atmosphere, setting, graphics and audio. Its controls, voice acting and inventory system were criticized, however, and certain reviewers disliked its puzzles. The game has become a million-seller, and is the franchise's most successful title on a single platform. Years after its first release, Resident Evil 2 was included in several lists of the 100 best games. Following its initial success on the PlayStation, it was ported to Microsoft Windows, the Nintendo 64, Dreamcast and Nintendo GameCube, and was released as a modified 2.5D version for the Game.com handheld. The story of Resident Evil 2 was retold and built upon in several later games, and has been adapted into a variety of licensed works.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/Resident_Evil_2.jpg/250px-Resident_Evil_2.jpg;PC, PS;http://www.capcom.co.jp/bio_series/biohazard2.html;M

Overlord ;Action Adventure;06/26/07;Triumph Studios ;Codemasters ;"Overlord is a third-person action-adventure game developed by Triumph Studios and published by Codemasters for the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3. The former two versions of the game were released in North America on June 26, 2007, then later in Europe on June 29 and Australia on July 6, 2007.  

Development on the game began in early 2006  and the game was first announced in May of the same year,  with actual gameplay demonstrated at E3 2006.  After over a year and a half of development,  its release in 2007 was met with generally favourable reviews   and helped boost overall sales for Codemasters that year.  An expansion pack entitled Overlord: Raising Hell was announced on November 1, 2007  and released February 15, 2008 along with additional multiplayer maps and a local split screen co-op mode.  A PlayStation 3 version of the game also entitled Overlord: Raising Hell was released in 2008 in Europe on June 20, and June 24 in North America,  which included both the original game and its downloadable content.  A sequel for all three systems entitled Overlord II was announced the same year on August 13  along with a spin-off for the Wii entitled Overlord: Dark Legend  and a Nintendo DS game called Overlord: Minions. 

Overlord is set in an unnamed fantasy world, where the player takes the role of a resurrected warrior known simply as The Overlord who has control over hordes of gremlin-like creatures known as ""minions"". The player must defeat seven corrupt ruling heroes in order to reconquer the lands and establish his lordship over its inhabitants. The game features a corruption feature, similar to that of the Fable games, but allowing the player to ""be evil... or really evil,""  where certain actions and choices affect different aspects of the story and gameplay. While the Overlord is controlled in a third person perspective, the way minions are controlled brings elements of real time strategy and upgrades bring those of role-playing games. The game also uses black humour and is often a satire and parody of the traditional fantasy setting and plot.

It includes quests, personal missions, skills and special abilities for customizing the character hero from a small set of races and class specializations. Dungeon Lords can be played either single-player stand alone, or in multi-player group sessions.

Many have criticized the game's initial release as a rushed project, released before it was truly finished. Some have gone so far as to say the game is still in the beta Development stage. One reviewer claimed that ""Dungeon Lords marks a new low for how incomplete a game can be and still get released"".  These criticisms stem from the numerous bugs contained in the 1.0 release, most notably buttons on screen and in the tutorials which do not work. According to the creators, the bug issues are being addressed and are planned to be resolved in a series of patches. Even with the release of the final patch for Dungeon Lords, version 1.4, many features remain missing and gameplay still suffers from numerous bugs. With the virtual demise of developer Heuristic Park and the publisher DreamCatcher Games being acquired and refocused by JoWood Productions any and all further support and development for Dungeon Lords has been terminated.

Dungeon Lords: The Orb and the Oracle, the sequel to Dungeon Lords, was in development with expected release in Q4, 2009. It has since been put on hold indefinitely due to market research results and game engine instability. Later the game was cancelled and replaced with Dungeon Lords MMXII.

Many gamers experienced extensive problems while playing the original release of the game, including quest items disappearing from inventories, NPCs getting stuck, key quests failing, doors that don't work, etc.

Tomb Raider: Underworld ;Action Adventure;11/18/08;Crystal Dynamics ;Eidos Interactive;"Tomb Raider: Underworld is the eighth instalment of the Tomb Raider series, following character Lara Croft. The story continues from the events in Tomb Raider: Legend as a direct sequel, but also addresses unexplained plot elements by association with Tomb Raider: Anniversary; the 2007 remake of the original Tomb Raider (1996).  The three games are subsequently merged into the renowned stand-alone Tomb Raider Trilogy of the late 2000s, by the series' second continuation developer Crystal Dynamics. Underworld is the third game in the series to be developed by Crystal Dynamics and is also the first Tomb Raider game to be released on the PlayStation 3.

Underworld received mostly positive reviews for the PS3, Xbox 360, and PC versions. Critics praised the environments, Lara's motion captured movements, story, puzzles, exploration, graphics and the less linear style of gameplay, although some aimed at its ""haywire"" camera angles and ""dodgy"" combat system. The PS2 and Wii versions received mostly moderate to negative reviews. Most cited them as having medium/poor graphics, being oversimplified and ""dumbed"" down, and some bugs, especially the PS2 version.

As of 27 February 2009, the game has sold 2.6 million copies worldwide. On 25 May 2009 it was announced Tomb Raider: Underworld would be re-released as part of the Xbox Classics and Platinum Range lines for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, respectively.

Anachronox ;Role Playing Game (RPG);06/25/01;Ion Storm;Eidos Interactive;"Anachronox (play /əˈnækrənɒks/,  created from anachronism and noxious ) is a 2001 third-person role-playing video game produced by Tom Hall and the Dallas Ion Storm games studio. It offers gameplay in the style of older role-playing video games, such as Chrono Trigger and the Final Fantasy series. The game was built with a heavily modified version of the Quake II engine, rewritten chiefly to allow a wider color palette, emotive animations and facial expressions, and better lighting, particle, and camera effects. 

The game features a science fiction story influenced by cyberpunk, film noir, and quirky humor.    The story begins as down-and-out private investigator Sylvester ""Sly Boots"" Bucelli looks for work in the slums of Anachronox, an alien planet near the hub of the galaxy's space-lanes. He travels to other planets and, amassing an unlikely group of friends, unravels a mystery that threatens the existence of the universe. The story features a theme of working through troublesome events of one's past, and ends on a major cliffhanger.  

The development of Anachronox was long and difficult; so much content was removed during production that Tom Hall planned to create a sequel. Critics enjoyed the game and awarded it high marks for its design and story, but its developers were disappointed with producer support, and Ion Storm closed its Dallas offices one month after the game's release. Anachronox developed a cult following, and in 2003, the game's cinematic director, Jake Hughes, spliced together sequences and cutscenes into a feature-length, award-winning machinima film.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/Anachronoxcover.jpg;PC;http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.eidosinteractive.com/games/info.html?gmid=6;

The game was released for the Microsoft Windows and Macintosh operating systems in September 2008 as Spore. A special edition of the game, Spore: Galactic Edition, additionally includes a Making of Spore DVD video, How to Build a Better Being DVD video by National Geographic Channel, The Art of Spore hardback mini-book, a fold-out Spore poster and a 100-page Galactic Handbook published by Prima Games.  As part of its license, Electronic Arts released Spore Origins, an arcade-style game for mobile devices, and Spore Creatures, a light RPG for the Nintendo DS. Spore: Galactic Adventures, an expansion pack for the PC game, Spore Hero and Spore Hero Arena for Wii and Nintendo DS respectively, is in the fall 2009 lineup, and Spore Creature Keeper have been announced as part of the 2009 lineup. 

Covering many genres including action, real-time strategy, and role-playing games (RPG), Spore allows a player to control the development of a species from its beginnings as a microscopic organism, through development as an intelligent and social creature, to interstellar exploration as a spacefaring culture. It has drawn wide attention for its massive scope, and its use of open-ended gameplay and procedural generation. Throughout each stage, players are able to use various creators to produce content for their games. These can then be uploaded to the online Sporepedia and downloaded by other players.

Spore was released after several delays to generally favourable reviews. Praise was given for the fact that the game allowed players to create practically any creature, vehicle and building. However, Spore was criticised for its gameplay which was seen as shallow by many reviewers; GameSpot remarked: ""Individual gameplay elements are extremely simple."" Controversy surrounded Spore for SecuROM, its DRM software, which can potentially open the user's computer to security risks.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/77/Sporebox.jpg;PC;http://www.spore.com/;T

The Lord of the Rings: Conquest ;Action Adventure;01/13/09;Pandemic Studios ;Electronic Arts;"The Lord of the Rings: Conquest is an action game developed by Pandemic Studios and published by Electronic Arts. It is based on The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, and borrows many gameplay mechanics from Pandemic's Star Wars: Battlefront games. The game allows the player to play as both the forces of good and evil, but unlike The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth, the latter option is based around Sauron stopping the One Ring from being destroyed and using it to regain his lost power.  On December 23, 2008, the PlayStation 3 demo was made available on the PlayStation Network  while the Xbox 360 demo was released January 2, 2009. 

Pandemic was aided by Weta Digital in developing the game. They provided many of their digital models, including the fell beasts. Pandemic also used elements that were cut from the films, and have taken inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien's original fantasy novel, such as a level based loosely around Balin's conquest of Moria, in which Gimli attempts to retake the dwarven city from the orcs. Some inspiration was less direct: the armies of Rohan and Gondor decide not to attack Minas Morgul in the novel, but a level in the game is based on what might possibly have happened if they had. The game uses Howard Shore's score to the films as its soundtrack. 

On March 16, 2010, the online multiplayer modes of The Lord of the Rings: Conquest were shut down for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.  On August 16, 2010 a group of fans launched the non-profit CNQReboot servers, allowing users of the PC version to play online using tunnelling software that allows network play via the local area network option.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/74/LOTR_Conquest.jpg/250px-LOTR_Conquest.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://pandemicstudios.com/conquest/;T
Shogun: Total War ;Turn Based Strategy;06/13/00;The Creative Assembly;Electronic Arts;"Shogun: Total War is a turn-based strategy and real-time tactics computer game developed by The Creative Assembly and published by Electronic Arts. Released in June 2000, the game is the debut title in The Creative Assembly's Total War series. Set in Japan during the Sengoku jidai—the ""Warring States"" period from the mid-15th century to the beginning of the 17th century—the game has players adopt the role of a contemporary Japanese clan, attempt to conquer the nation and claim the position of shogun. The turn-based aspect of the game focuses on a map of Japan where military force, religion, diplomacy, espionage and economics all influence the player's actions, whilst battles are fought in a real-time mode. Sun Tzu's The Art of War is central to the game; its precepts are quoted often and its strategies recommended.

Announced in early 1999, Shogun: Total War was The Creative Assembly's first high business risk product; previous products had involved creating video games for the EA Sports brand. The game was initially conceived as a real-time strategy ""B-title""[citation needed] powered by 2D computer graphics following the popularisation of the genre through titles such as Command & Conquer. However, proliferation of 3D video cards amongst consumers led to a transition to 3D graphics. Through the course of development, Shogun: Total War evolved into a real-time tactics game with a focus on historical authenticity; military historian Stephen Turnbull advised The Creative Assembly in this regard. The turn-based campaign map was added to include context for the real-time battles.

Shogun: Total War was well received critically, though complaints surfaced regarding glitches in the game. The game holds scores of 84% and 87% on the review aggregator sites Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. An expansion pack, The Mongol Invasion, followed in August 2001, adding a playable version of the Mongol invasions of Japan. The game's positive reception paved the way for the development of successive Total War releases set in different times and regions, leading it to become a well known franchise. The latest game, Shogun 2: Total War, is a sequel which returns to the Sengoku period albeit with all the improvements in graphical technology and gameplay since the first game. It was announced in June 2010  and released in March 2011.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/71/Shogun_Total_War.jpg;PC;http://www.totalwar.com/;T

Mass Effect 2 ;Action RPG;01/26/10;BioWare;Electronic Arts ;"Mass Effect 2 is an action role-playing game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The game was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on January 26, 2010 and for PlayStation 3 on January 18, 2011.   It is the second chapter in the Mass Effect trilogy of video games.

Gameplay in Mass Effect 2 is influenced by decisions from the original Mass Effect. Many aspects of the game have been changed and refined, including a complex inventory system and the removal of both the Mako and long elevator rides. Conversations with the A.I. have been given a more cinematic touch and players are now able to use a context-sensitive interrupt system. In combat, players now have ammunition and regenerable health.

After the events of Mass Effect, the Normandy is attacked by an unknown starship and Commander Shepard is killed. Shepard's body is recovered and he/she is brought back to life by Cerberus, a human supremacist organization led by the Illusive Man. Shepard eventually learns that the Reapers were responsible and working by proxy through an insect-like species called the Collectors, and that they are responsible for entire human colonies disappearing throughout the galaxy. Shepard must recruit and gain the loyalty of a diverse team in order to defeat the Collectors in a suicide mission.

A critical and commercial success, Mass Effect 2 shipped over two million copies worldwide in its first week of release,  and has received universal critical acclaim.  It is currently the third best reviewed game for Xbox 360 and the 14th best reviewed game of all time, according to GameRankings.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ;Action Adventure;11/08/05;EA Bright Light ;Electronic Arts ;"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a 2005 computer and video game that was released right before the film release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Both the game and the movie are based on J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth novel in the Harry Potter series.

The game follows the three main characters of the film — namely Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley — and there is an entirely new spell-casting system that allows for collaborative spells. The characters themselves more closely resemble their film counterparts than in previous games. It also has higher-quality graphics than the previous Harry Potter video games. However, the game play in the fourth video game is much more action-oriented, which is a change from the previous games.

In addition, players can play the game with friends, and can combine their magic and spells to make them more powerful. Players can also capture moving beans using Accio and increase their power with collectors, creature, and character, cards.

There is no RPG iteration of the game, unlike with previous titles. In addition, it was pointed out that unlike the previous installments, there was not much room to ""run around"" such as in the second game where you were allowed to move freely within the castle and on the grounds.

The game is divided into several non-consecutive levels, some of which are locked at the beginning of the game until the player collects enough Triwizard Shields to unlock it.

It is noted as the last Harry Potter game released on GameCube and Xbox, its also the first Harry Potter Game to get an E10+ Rating in North America .";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d3/HP_goblet_of_fire.png;PC, PS 2, Xbox;http://harrypotter.ea.com/;E

Mirror's Edge ;First Person Shooter (FPS);01/12/09;EA Digital Illusions CE ;Electronic Arts ;"Mirror's Edge is a single-player first person action-adventure video game developed by EA Digital Illusions CE (DICE) and published by Electronic Arts. The game was announced on July 10, 2007, and was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2008. A Microsoft Windows version was released on January 13, 2009. Mirror's Edge is powered by the Unreal Engine 3 with the addition of a new lighting solution, developed by Illuminate Labs in association with DICE.

The game has a brightly coloured style and differs from most other first-person perspective video games in allowing for a wider range of actions—such as sliding under barriers, tumbling, wall-running, and shimmying across ledges—and greater freedom of movement; in having no heads-up display; and in allowing the legs, arms, and torso of the character to be visible on-screen. Mirror's Edge is set in a futuristic dystopian society, in which a network of 'runners', including the main character, Faith, are used as couriers to transmit messages while evading government surveillance. In the style of a three-dimensional platform game, the player guides Faith over rooftops, across walls, and through ventilation shafts, negotiating obstacles using movements inspired by parkour.

Mirror's Edge has received mostly positive reviews, with the PC version garnering a Metacritic aggregated score of 81%. The game's uniqueness and its expansive environments have received praise, while criticism has centred on its weakness of plot, trial and error gameplay and short length. A soundtrack featuring remixes of the final credits song ""Still Alive"" by Swedish singer Lisa Miskovsky (unrelated to the song of the same name featured in 2007 game Portal) was also released. A side-scroller version of the game for the Apple iPad was released on April 1, 2010 and for the iPhone on September 2, 2010.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/97/Mirror%27s_Edge.jpg/250px-Mirror%27s_Edge.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://www.mirrorsedge.com/;M

Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri ;Turn Based Strategy;01/31/99;Firaxis Games;Electronic Arts ;"Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri (SMAC) is the critically acclaimed science fiction 4X turn-based strategy video game sequel to the Civilization series. Sid Meier, designer of Civilization, and Brian Reynolds, designer of Civilization II, developed Alpha Centauri after they left MicroProse to join the newly created developer Firaxis Games. Electronic Arts released both SMAC and its expansion, Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire (SMAX), in 1999. In the following year, Aspyr Media and Loki Software ported both titles over to Mac OS and Linux.

Set in the 22nd century, the game begins as seven competing ideological factions land on the planet Chiron (""Planet"") in the Alpha Centauri star system. As the game progresses, Planet's growing sentience becomes a formidable obstacle to the human colonists. Alpha Centauri features improvements on Civilization II's game engine, including simultaneous multiplay, social engineering, climate, customizable units, alien native life, additional diplomatic and spy options, additional ways to win, and greater mod-ability . Alien Crossfire introduces five new human and two non-human factions as well as additional technologies, facilities, secret projects, native life, unit abilities and a victory condition.

The game received wide critical acclaim, being compared favorably to Civilization II. Critics praised its science fiction storyline (comparing the plot to works by Stanley Kubrick, Frank Herbert, Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov), the in-game writing, the voice acting, the user-created custom units, and the depth of the technology tree. SMAC also won several awards for best game of the year and best strategy game of the year.

Hellgate: London ;Role Playing Game (RPG);10/31/07;Flagship Studios ;Electronic Arts ;"Hellgate, originally known as Hellgate: London, is a dark fantasy themed action role-playing game originally developed by Flagship Studios, released on October 31, 2007. It was developed by a team headed by former Blizzard Entertainment employees, some of whom had overseen the creation of the Diablo series. In 2008 Flagship Studios filed bankruptcy and all intellectual property was seized because it was used as collateral for funding received from Comerica Bank. Subsequently, development of the game halted. Namco Bandai Games provided free ongoing US/EU server support in the fall of Flagship Studios until 31 January 2009, when the US/EU multiplayer game servers and websites were taken offline.  HanbitSoft has since acquired properties to the game and has redeveloped it as Hellgate London: Resurrection. As of June 2011, Hanbitsoft's redesigned game is currently live in Korea,  and the North American release, published by subsidiary T3Fun, has undergone (closed) beta testing and open beta testing commenced on June 30, 2011 as free to play. 

Set in a post-apocalyptic London in the year 2038, Hellgate: London is a fast paced action role playing 'hack and slasher'. The game featured both singleplayer and online multiplayer support when it was released although US/EU online support has since shutdown. Flagship Studios released 1 major MP content update The Stonehenge Chronicles and the 2nd The Abyss Chronicles on the test server before the studio's closure. Similar to the Diablo series, randomization is embedded into many of the game mechanics including weapon and armor attributes, item drops, mob spawns and level composition. The singleplayer version features a 5 act story quest line and when completed, the player is eligible to restart the story line again in Nightmare difficulty and create new characters in Elite mode.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/Hellgate_London.jpg/256px-Hellgate_London.jpg;PC;http://hellgate.iahgames.com/gameSite/default.asp;M

System Shock 2 ;Action Adventure;07/31/99;Irrational Games ;Electronic Arts ;"System Shock 2 is a 1999 first-person action role-playing video game, designed by Ken Levine for Microsoft Windows. The title is a sequel to the 1994 PC game System Shock, and was co-developed by Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios. The sequel was originally designed as a standalone title with no relation to System Shock; story changes were made when Electronic Arts—who owned the Shock franchise rights—signed on as publisher. System Shock 2 was released on August 11, 1999 in North America.

The game takes place on board a starship in a cyberpunk depiction of 2114. The player assumes the role of a lone soldier trying to stem the outbreak of a genetic infection that has devastated the ship. Like System Shock, gameplay consists of first person shooting and exploration. The game also incorporates role-playing system elements, where the player can develop unique skills and traits, such as hacking and psionic abilities.

System Shock 2 received positive reviews when released, but failed to meet commercial sales expectations. In retrospect, many critics have determined the game to be highly influential, particularly on first person shooters, and far ahead of its time, and inducted it into several ""greatest games of all time"" lists. In January 2006, Computer and Video Games reported System Shock 3 may be under development. As of January 2009, nothing conclusive has surfaced regarding the purported project's status. In 2007, Irrational—then 2K Boston/2K Australia—released a self-proclaimed 'spiritual successor' to the System Shock series, entitled BioShock, to critical acclaim and strong sales.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/91/Systemshock2box.jpg;PC;http://irrationalgames.com/projects/system-shock-2/;M

Dreamfall: The Longest Journey ;Adventure game;04/17/06;Funcom;Empire Interactive;"Dreamfall: The Longest Journey (Norwegian: Drømmefall: Den lengste reisen) is an adventure video game with elements of action-adventure. It was released for the Windows and Xbox platforms on 17 April 2006 by Norwegian developer Funcom. On 1 March 2007, an episodic sequel entitled Dreamfall Chapters was announced,  and Funcom reportedly considered the idea of a massively multiplayer online game set in the The Longest Journey universe. 

The game is the sequel to Funcom's The Longest Journey, released in 1999, and takes place ten years after the events of the first game. The story focuses on three characters, Zoë Castillo, April Ryan, and Kian Alvane, who live in two parallel worlds: technologically advanced Stark and magical Arcadia. April was the protagonist of the first game, while the other two are new characters. The main storyline follows Zoë, a Stark resident whose investigation of her ex-boyfriend's disappearance and other mysterious occurrences lead her to April. Meanwhile in Arcadia, April battles the villainous Empire of Azadi while Kian, an elite Azadi soldier, is sent to assassinate her. The game features returning characters from its predecessor, such as Brian Westhouse and Gordon Halloway, but playing The Longest Journey is not a prerequisite to understanding its plot.

Dreamfall was generally well received by both critics and players. The media praised the story and the characterisation in the game, but criticized its fighting and stealth elements, as well as the abrupt cliffhanger ending. The PC and Xbox versions of the game received average scores of 75% and 73%, respectively, on the review compilation website Metacritic,  compared with the original game which scored 91%.  According to Funcom's annual 2006 report, the sales for the PC version were ""satisfactory"", while the Xbox one failed to meet expectations, presumably because Xbox 360 eclipsed the original Xbox around the time Dreamfall was released";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/Dreamfall_cover.jpg/250px-Dreamfall_cover.jpg;PC, Xbox;http://www.dreamfall.com/;T

These were drawn from previous testers of Firefly Studios games, others volunteered via prominent fansites.

In addition to the central theme of castle construction and design, Stronghold Kingdoms incorporates a variety of architectural, economic, military, agricultural, mercantile, industrial and political elements which challenge players ability to prioritize, direct work-flow and resources and administrate their holdings in the manner of a medieval land holder or noble. An individual player's success is not entirely predicated upon the ability to defeat computer-generated enemies, but also upon teamwork with fellow players.

The player begins relatively alone, one village amongst others in a single parish. From this beginning, strategic decisions are made and dialogue established with fellow parish members which introduces the social aspect of Stronghold Kingdoms. All players can vie for stewardship of the parish, dependent on rank. When two or more players wish to be Steward they can negotiate to decide who will take control of the parish, or take it by force, razing out the opposing players village from that parish. If Theology is researched, then monks can be deployed to infiltrate the parish and influence the vote. This is usually referred to as a monk war in the game vernacular. When the successful candidate becomes steward they gain control of the parish army along with the ability to set taxes (tithe), and build the necessary guilds to improve life for all in the parish.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/26/SHK-logo.png;PC;http://www.strongholdkingdoms.com/;T

Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened ;Adventure game;03/01/07;Frogwares ;Focus Home Interactive ;"Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened is an adventure game developed by Frogwares and published in 2006 for Microsoft Windows. The game follows an original plotline as Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr. John H. Watson investigate a series of strange disappearances related to the Cthulhu Mythos.

The third in the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes series of adventure games developed by Frogwares, The Awakened was preceded in 2002 by Sherlock Holmes: Mystery of the Mummy and in 2004 by Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Silver Earring. This is the first game in the series to tackle supernatural elements such as the Cthulhu Mythos, the previous two games having fairly traditional (albeit original) Holmesian plots.

In 2008, a remastered version was released that offers the ability to play in a third-person perspective mode in addition to the first-person perspective. The version also features improved graphics and changes to the help system, this the first (and so far only) ""Sherlock Holmes"" game to get an M (Mature 17+) rating the ERSB. The remastered version became available on Steam on August 6, 2009.

Since its release in 2007, Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened has attracted a huge worldwide audience, earning high marks from reviewers and consumers alike. Regarded by many as one of the best uses of a license (earning GameSpot's ""Best Use of a License"" award in 2007)– The Awakened is one of the key titles in the adventure genre in the past several years.";http://content.answcdn.com/main/content/img/amg/games/drg200/g276/g27650rs9po.jpg;PC;http://www.sherlockholmes-thegame.com/;M

It was launched in the summer of 2007. Granado Espada won the 2006 Korean Presidential Award for Best Graphics and Game of the Year,  with features previously unseen  in an MMORPG (such as the ability for players to control multiple characters at the same time). Granado Espada features a unique art style based on the Baroque period of Europe, differing from the standard “sword and sorcery” fantasy themes of the genre.

The first English version of the game began Open Beta Testing on May 17, 2007 by IAHGames, while K2 Network announced in January 2007 that they would be bringing Granado Espada to the North American and European markets in Summer 2007 under the title of Sword of the New World.  The game was originally released under a pay-to-play model. On August 21, 2007, Sword of the New World became free-to-play.

On 10 August 2007, IAHGames, the company which the game is licensed to in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam as well as Australia and New Zealand, announced its business model for Granado Espada.  Subsequently they informed players that on August 30, 2007, the game would become commercial. IAHGames gave players a 90-day free trial if they achieved Level 20 by that time. New players have a free five-day trial period and after which, they are required to pay. On December 5, 2007, as with other servers overseas, the game became free-to-play.

After more than three years of operation The9, licensee and operator of the mainland Chinese regional server, has announced that it would terminate Granado Espada's game service, citing the expiration of its contract with IMC Games. It has since stopped accepting new registrants from September 22, 2010, and began to wind down the regional server gradually.  On the midnight of November 22, 2010, the servers officially went down. Game service in Mainland China subsequently resumed in March, 2011 under a new licensee.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/71/GranadoEspada.png/300px-GranadoEspada.png;PC;http://www.gamersfirst.com/sword2/;T

It was released on Microsoft Windows on June 18, 2002. BioWare later released a free Linux client in June 2003, requiring a purchased copy of the game to play.  MacSoft released a Mac OS X port in August 2003. Interplay Entertainment was originally set to publish the game but financial difficulties led to a change of publisher.

The game is set in the fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, with the game mechanics based on the third edition Dungeons & Dragons rules. The game engine was designed around an internet-based model for running a massively multiplayer game, which would allow end users to host game servers. The intent was to create a potentially infinite massively multiplayer game framework. This game was named after the original Neverwinter Nights online game; the first ever graphical MMORPG,  which operated from 1991 to 1997 on AOL.

The original release of Neverwinter Nights includes the game engine, a game campaign that can be played as single player or in multiplayer mode, and, on Windows releases, the Aurora toolset used for creating custom content that would run in the same engine. Three expansion packs were subsequently released for the game. Shadows of Undrentide was released in June 2003, Hordes of the Underdark in December 2003 and Kingmaker in November 2004. BioWare then began selling premium modules through an online store in late 2004.

Fallout ;Role Playing Game (RPG);09/30/97;Interplay Entertainment ;Interplay Entertainment ;"Fallout is an open world role-playing video game produced by Tim Cain, developed and published by Interplay in 1997. The game has a post-apocalyptic and retro-futuristic setting in the mid-22nd century, featuring an alternate history which deviates some time after World War II, where technology, politics and culture followed a different course.

The game is sometimes considered to be an unofficial sequel to the 1987 CRPG Wasteland,  but it could not use that title as Electronic Arts held the rights to it; and, except for minor references, the games are set in separate universes. It was also intended to use Steve Jackson Games' GURPS system, but that deal fell through due to the excessive amounts of violence and gore included in the game,  forcing Black Isle to change the already implemented GURPS system to the internally developed SPECIAL system.

Critically acclaimed, the game inspired a number of sequels and spin-off games, known collectively as the Fallout series";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/af/Fallout.jpg;PC;http://fallout.bethsoft.com/;M

An official expansion pack was released, entitled Descent 3: Mercenary, and fans of the game have also made other modifications.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/D3_Box_Art.jpg/256px-D3_Box_Art.jpg;PC;http://www.descent3.com/;M

Sacrifice ;Real Time Strategy (RTS);11/05/00;Shiny Entertainment ;Interplay Entertainment ;"Sacrifice is a real-time strategy video game published by Interplay Entertainment in 2000 for the Windows 98 platform. Developed by Shiny Entertainment the game features elements of action and other genres. Players control wizards who fight each other with spells and summoned creatures. Impressing reviewers with its graphics, Sacrifice was the first commercial video game to make full use of video graphics cards that can process transform, clipping, and lighting instructions. The game was ported to Mac OS 9.2 in 2001.

Unlike many of its contemporary real-time strategy games, Sacrifice places little emphasis on resource gathering and management. There is no system of workers; the players' wizards collect souls to summon creatures, and their mana—energy for casting spells—constantly regenerates. Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods. To defeat an opponent, the player's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard's altar, thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard. Aside from a single-player campaign, Sacrifice offers a multiplayer mode, in which up to four players can play against each other over computer networks.

Sacrifice was created by a small team of developers; most of the work was done by four key personnel. The graphic engine of the game uses tessellation: thousands of polygons are used to display an object and as lesser details are needed, the number of polygons is reduced. By adjusting the required level of detail, Sacrifice can be run on various machines with the highest possible quality of graphics. Complementing the graphics of the game were the voice work of professional actors, such as Tim Curry, and the musical compositions of Kevin Manthei. Sacrifice was praised by reviewers for the novel designs of its creatures and for its humorous content. The high level of attention needed to manage its frenetic combat was mentioned as a flaw. Despite winning several awards, Sacrifice was not a commercial success, and no sequels are planned.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/82/Sacrifice_by_Interplay_-_box_art.jpg/256px-Sacrifice_by_Interplay_-_box_art.jpg;PC;;M

Wizard101 ;Role Playing Game (RPG);09/02/08;KingsIsle Entertainment ;KingsIsle Entertainment ;"Wizard101 is a 3D massively multiplayer online role-playing game created by KingsIsle Entertainment.   Players take on the role of students of Wizardry to save the Spiral (which is the set of worlds this game takes place in), and battle a variety of creatures by casting spells using a turn-based combat system similar to collectible card. Players advance in the game by accepting quests to learn new spells, gain equipment, and collect gold.  The game holds a rating of ""Everyone 10+"" from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board for crude humor and mild fantasy violence.  Although designed for pre-teens, the game appeals to all ages.  

At the beginning the player controls a novice wizard, who is named by the player using a set of words at the start of the game. That wizard joins the Ravenwood School of Magical Arts, a school of wizardry located in a fictional town called Wizard City.  Instead of the traditional character classes, Wizard101 offers players a choice among seven different ""magic schools"" (Fire, Ice, Storm, Myth, Life, Death, and Balance) which will influence character development and parts of the magical spells (in form of collectible cards) available to the player in combat.

In Wizard101, the different areas accessible to players are referred to as ""worlds"". Upon character creation, only a part of Wizard City (The Commons, Ravenwood, Unicorn Way, Olde Town, Shopping District, Triton Avenue, Golem Court, and a short introduction to the world of Grizzleheim) is opened to access. As the player progresses, more worlds become available. Availability depends on subscriptions and/or the purchase of crowns. People who purchase memberships receive special privileges and gifts.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bd/Wizard101_Logo.jpg;PC;http://www.wizard101central.com/;E

Silent Hill: Homecoming ;Survival horror;11/06/08;Double Helix Games ;Konami;"Silent Hill Homecoming is the sixth installment in the Silent Hill survival horror video game series, developed by Double Helix Games.  The game was announced on July 11, 2007 by Konami at their E3 press conference, and was originally entitled Silent Hill V.  This entry follows the journey of Alex Shepherd, a soldier returning from war, to his hometown of Shepherd's Glen, where he finds the town in disarray, and his younger brother missing. As he continues on his search to find his younger brother, he discovers more about the Order—the cult of Silent Hill—as well as the town's history, and his own past.

The game was released on September 30, 2008 in North America for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and the Microsoft Windows version was released for North, Central and South America on November 6, 2008 exclusively through Valve's Steam digital content delivery service.  All versions were simultaneously released in Europe, including a retail Microsoft Windows version, on February 27, 2009. The Japanese version was cancelled. 

Homecoming received generally good reviews, with positive reaction to the graphics, audio, and environments, and less favorable reaction to the game's plot and scenario, and some of the gameplay and horror elements; however, overall, reviewers were largely appreciative of the development of a home console installment of the franchise by an external Western developer.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f1/Silent_Hill_Homecoming.jpg/250px-Silent_Hill_Homecoming.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;;M
Silent Hill 2 ;Survival horror;12/02/02;Konami;Konami;"Silent Hill 2 is a survival horror video game published by Konami for the PlayStation 2 and developed by Team Silent, a production group within Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. The second installment in the Silent Hill series, the game was released in September 2001; an extended version of it was released for the Xbox in December of the same year as Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams in North America and Silent Hill 2: Inner Fears in Europe, and for the PlayStation 2 in 2002 as Silent Hill 2: Director's Cut, with a port of Director's Cut to Microsoft Windows released in December 2002. Silent Hill 2 has been re-released multiple times, including under the Greatest Hits label and as part of The Silent Hill Collection, while a remastered high-definition version of it was released for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 on March 20, 2012. 

While set in the series' multiverse, which consists of reality and two alternate dimensions whose form is based on the series' eponymous fictional American town, Silent Hill 2 is not a direct sequel to the first Silent Hill game. Instead, it centers on James Sunderland, who enters the town after receiving a letter written by his deceased wife, saying she is waiting for him in their ""special place"" in Silent Hill. Joined by Maria, who strongly resembles her, he searches for her and discovers the truth about her death. Additional material in re-releases and ports included Born from a Wish, a sub-scenario which focuses on Maria before she and James meet.

Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person view and gameplay places a greater emphasis on finding items and solving riddles than combat. Psychological aspects such as the gradual disappearance of Mary's letter were added to the game. More humanoid than their counterparts in the preceding game, some of the monsters were designed as a reflection of James' subconscious. Real-life references to history, films and literary works can also be found in the game.

Silent Hill 2 was positively received by the audience and critics. Within the month of its release in North America, Japan, and Europe, over one million copies were sold, with the greatest sales in North America. English-language critics praised the atmosphere, graphics, story and monster designs of Silent Hill 2, but criticized the controls as difficult to use. Silent Hill 2 appeared on several critics' top lists for its story and use of metaphors, psychological horror and taboo topics.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/95/Silent_Hill_2.jpg/260px-Silent_Hill_2.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/sh2/index.html;M

Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, a prequel to the entire Metal Gear series, followed in 2004. In 2008, a direct sequel, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots was released.

The story revolves around the ""Big Shell"", a massive offshore clean-up facility that has been seized by a group of terrorists that call themselves ""Sons of Liberty"". They demand a massive ransom in exchange for the life of the President of the United States, and threaten to destroy the facility and create a cataclysmic environmental disaster if their demands are not met.

It has been considered the first example of a postmodern video game,     and has been cited as a primary example of artistic expression in video games.

A Microsoft Windows version was originally planned by Konami Productions, but was rumored to have been cancelled since December 2011.   Set several years after the events of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, the story will focus on the former agent Raiden who is to be encountered by cyborg enemies while aiding in the rebuilding of an unknown country.

Saw ;Survival horror;10/31/09;Zombie Studios ;Konami ;"Saw, also known as Saw: The Video Game, is a third person survival horror video game with action elements that was developed by Zombie Studios and published by Konami. The game launched on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, with a downloadable version released soon after for the Microsoft Windows platform. The game was first released on October 6, 2009, in North America and was released later that year in other regions. The Microsoft Windows version was released on October 22, 2009. The game is an adaptation of the Saw film series that was released around the same time as Saw VI, although they have entirely separate storylines.

In Saw, The Jigsaw Killer has healed Detective David Tapp from his gunshot wound, and places him in an abandoned insane asylum to teach him a lesson in life appreciation. Obsessed, Tapp traverses the asylum and gathers clues along the way in hopes of finally apprehending Jigsaw. As he progresses through the asylum, he encounters several people with past and current connections to him, whom he must save. The asylum also has inhabitants who are in games of their own, ordered to kill Tapp. Along the way, Tapp uncovers the origins of Jigsaw and the motives behind his tests. The development team brought in the Saw creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell to write a new storyline and create new trap designs exclusive to the game.

Upon release, Saw received mixed reviews.  It was praised for the storyline and multiple endings, as well as the immersive environment that is true to the Saw film series. The controls and combat system, however, were panned by critics. Since Konami purchased the publishing rights after former publisher Brash Entertainment went bankrupt, Konami had a significant input on the games' final outcome. They stated that they have plans to make Saw their next big franchise as well as a spiritual successor to their other survival horror series, Silent Hill. A sequel, Saw II: Flesh & Blood, was released on multiple platforms on October 19, 2010.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/84/Saw_Box_Art_6.JPG;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://www.konami.com/games/saw/;M

Schizm ;Adventure game;10/17/01;LK Avalon ;LK Avalon ;"Schizm: Mysterious Journey is an adventure-genre computer game created by Detalion and LK Avalon and published by DreamCatcher Games. It was authored by acclaimed Australian science fiction writer Terry Dowling.

The game is reminiscent of the Myst series of games (especially Riven) in that the environment is rendered very realistically and in exceptionally high detail. Movement and interaction in the game is very similar to that in the Myst games. The background sounds are realistic and dynamic (for example, footsteps change as a character walks over different surfaces such as metal and stone, and echo when inside tunnels). The background music is very atmospheric and highly evocative.

A major distinguishing feature of Schizm is that the player can switch control between the two characters at any time. There are puzzles which require both characters to be performing actions at the same time before they can be solved.

The game is available on 5 CDs or as a single DVD. The CD version does not include all the puzzles that appear in the DVD release and was also missing some of the background story.

A sequel, Mysterious Journey II (also known as Schizm II: Chameleon), was released. It was also authored by Terry Dowling";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2d/Schizm1.png/250px-Schizm1.png;PC;;E

Star Wars: Battle for Naboo ;Action Adventure;03/11/01;LucasArts ;LucasArts ;"Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo (known as Star Wars: Battle for Naboo on the PC) is an arcade-style action game co-developed by Factor 5 and LucasArts; LucasArts supplied most of the art and level-design, while Factor 5 provided the programming, tools, sound, and most of the cut-scene and art post-production work. It is a spiritual sequel to the successful Star Wars: Rogue Squadron released two years earlier. Despite the similarities between the two games, the development team designed a completely new game engine for Battle for Naboo and included land- and water-based combat in addition to aerial combat.

Set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy, the game takes place entirely during the events depicted in the film Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. Players control Gavyn Sykes, a lieutenant in Naboo's Royal Security Forces. As the game progresses, Sykes and the Royal Security Forces fight the Trade Federation in 15 missions that take place on Naboo or in the space immediately surrounding it. The game concludes after the player completes a mission that recreates the film's climactic assault on the Trade Federation's Droid Control Ship.

Battle for Naboo was published by LucasArts and THQ and released for the Nintendo 64 in December 2000. A Windows port was released three months later in March 2001. The Nintendo 64 version received generally positive reviews; critics praised the game's tight and responsive controls, but expressed dislike for the game's Episode I setting.

Tales of Monkey Island ;Compilation ;12/17/09;Telltale Games ;LucasArts ;"Tales of Monkey Island is a 2009 graphic adventure video game developed by Telltale Games and LucasArts. It is the fifth game in the Monkey Island series, released nearly a decade after the previous installment, Escape from Monkey Island. Developed for Windows and the Wii console, the game was released in five episodic segments, between July and December 2009. In contrast to Telltale's previous episodic adventure games, whose chapters told discrete stories, each chapter of Tales of Monkey Island is part of an ongoing narrative. The game was digitally distributed through WiiWare and Telltale's own website, and later through Steam and Amazon.com. Ports for Mac OS X, the PlayStation Network, and iOS were released several months after the series ended.

Players assume the role of pirate Guybrush Threepwood, who—while attempting to destroy his nemesis, the undead pirate LeChuck—accidentally releases a voodoo pox across the Gulf of Melange. With the assistance of his wife, Elaine Marley–Threepwood, Guybrush seeks out a cure. The game was conceived in late 2008, due to renewed interest in adventure game development within LucasArts. It was developed concurrently with LucasArts' special edition of the 1990 title The Secret of Monkey Island; LucasArts oversaw production of Tales of Monkey Island, and ensured that it matched the remake in certain areas, such as art direction. Production began in early 2009; franchise creator Ron Gilbert was involved in project planning, while development was led by Dave Grossman, who co-designed the first two Monkey Island games. The game's music was composed by Michael Land, and the core cast of The Curse of Monkey Island reprised their voice roles.

Tales of Monkey Island received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the game's story, writing, humor, voice acting and characterization; 1UP.com described Guybrush as Telltale's strongest and most expressive character yet. The game's music and graphics were also lauded. Complaints focused primarily on the perceived erratic quality of the game's puzzle design, a weak supporting cast in the early chapters, and the game's control system. Tales of Monkey Island garnered several industry awards, and was Telltale's most commercially successful project until Back to the Future: The Game.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/53/Tales_of_Monkey_Island_artwork.jpg/250px-Tales_of_Monkey_Island_artwork.jpg;PC;http://www.telltalegames.com/monkeyisland;E

Its story was created by Donald Mustard and featured a script written by science fiction writers Orson Scott Card and Cameron Dayton; the full orchestral soundtrack was done by Tommy Tallarico. As of September 14, 2006, Steam began offering Advent Rising for download as well as other games by Majesco. 

Much hyped Advent Rising was the first in a planned trilogy which also saw the development of a game that would take place alongside Advent Rising, called Advent Shadow for the PSP. Despite a large advertising campaign including promotion in cinemas, the game's retail performance fell far short of expectations.  By the end of 2005, Majesco Entertainment had completely revised its business plan to focus towards handheld games and canceled plans for future Advent Rising games.

A five-issue spin-off comic book series was produced and ran from October 2005 to November 2006. Plans for novel tie-ins by Orson Scott Card never came to fruition. In June 2006, Donald Mustard posted a statement on the website of his new venture, Chair Entertainment, stating that he ""would be happy to finish the Advent series if the opportunity presented itself,"" but confirmed he does not currently hold the rights to do so.

Halo 2 ;First Person Shooter (FPS);05/31/07;Bungie Studios ;Microsoft Studios;"Halo 2 is a first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie Studios. Released for the Xbox video game console on November 9, 2004,  the game is the second installment in the Halo franchise and the sequel to 2001's critically acclaimed Halo: Combat Evolved. A Microsoft Windows version of the game was released on May 31, 2007,  developed by an internal team as Microsoft Game Studios. The game features a new game engine, as well as using the Havok physics engine; added weapons and vehicles, and new multiplayer maps. The player alternately assumes the roles of the human Master Chief and the alien Arbiter in a twenty-sixth century conflict between the human United Nations Space Command and genocidal Covenant.

After the success of Combat Evolved, a sequel was expected and highly anticipated. Bungie found inspiration in plot points and gameplay elements that had been left out of their first game, including multiplayer over the internet through Xbox Live. Time constraints forced a series of cutbacks in the size and scope of the game, including a cliffhanger ending to the game's campaign mode that left many in the studio dissatisfied. Among Halo 2's marketing efforts was an alternate reality game called ""I Love Bees"" that involved players solving real-world puzzles.

On release, Halo 2 was the most popular video game on Xbox Live,  holding that rank until the release of Gears of War for the Xbox 360 nearly two years later.   By June 20, 2006, more than 500 million games of Halo 2 had been played and more than 710 million hours have been spent playing it on Xbox Live;  by May 9, 2007, this number had risen to more than five million unique players.  Halo 2 is the best-selling first-generation Xbox game  with at least 6.3 million copies sold in the United States alone.  Critical reception of the game was generally positive, with most publications lauding the strong multiplayer component. The campaign was the focus of criticism for its cliffhanger ending.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/92/Halo2-cover.png/250px-Halo2-cover.png;PC, Xbox;http://www.bungie.net/Projects/Halo2/;M

The game was initially announced by Chris Roberts in 1999, and following many production schedule mishaps and a buyout of Digital Anvil by Microsoft, it was eventually released in March 2003.

In the game, players take on the roles of spacecraft pilots. These characters fly single-seater ships, exploring the planets and space stations of 48 known star systems. They also engage in dogfights with other pilots (player- and computer-controlled) to protect traders or engage in piracy themselves. Other player activities include bounty-hunting and commodity trading. The single-player mode puts the player in the role of Edison Trent, who goes through a series of missions to save the Sirius sector from a mysterious alien force. In multiplayer mode, players are free to take on any role and to explore anywhere from the start.

Originally, Roberts promised features such as automated flight maneuvers, dynamic economies, and a multiplayer mode that could host thousands of players, but diminished versions of these features were implemented in the final release. The game's initial technical demos impressed reviewers, but after the Microsoft buyout and Roberts' departure from Digital Anvil, critics had doubts about the game.

Age of Empires II: The Conquerors Expansion ;Real Time Strategy (RTS);08/24/00;Ensemble Studios;Microsoft Studios;"Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings (often shortened to AGE2, The Age of Kings, AoE II or AoK) is a real-time strategy (RTS) video game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft. Released in 1999 for the Microsoft Windows and Macintosh operating systems, it was the second game in the Age of Empires series. An expansion, The Conquerors, was released in 2000. A PlayStation 2 version was released by Konami in 2001, and a Nintendo DS spinoff, Age of Empires: The Age of Kings was developed by Backbone Entertainment in 2006. The Dreamcast port, by Konami, was canceled.

The Age of Kings is set in the Middle Ages and contains thirteen playable civilizations. They are the Britons, Byzantines, Celts, Goths, Teutons, Franks, Mongols, Chinese, Japanese, Persians, Saracens, Turks and the Vikings. Players aim to gather resources, which they use to build towns, create armies, and defeat their enemies. There are five historically-based campaigns, which constrict the player to specialized and story-backed conditions. There are three additional single player game modes, and multiplayer is supported. Despite using the same game engine and similar code to its predecessor, development of The Age of Kings took a year longer than expected, forcing Ensemble Studios to release Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome in 1998 instead. The design team focused on resolving significant issues in Age of Empires, but noted on release that some problems remained.

Reception of The Age of Kings was overwhelmingly positive, and the game scored highly on review aggregators. The significant number of new features was praised, as were the gameplay improvements. Some reviewers were critical of the presentation of units—they were seen as bland and uninteresting—while others considered The Age of Kings to be overly similar to its predecessor, Age of Empires. Three months after its release, two million copies of The Age of Kings had been shipped, and it topped sales charts in seven countries.

The titles are historical real-time strategy games, and their gameplay revolves around two main game modes: random map and campaign. They competed with another popular strategy series, Civilization, and are set amidst historical events. Age of Empires focused on events in Europe, Africa and Asia, spanning from the Stone Age to the Iron Age; the expansion game explored the formation and expansion of the Roman Empire. The sequel, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, was set in the Middle Ages, while its expansion focused partially on the Spanish conquest of Mexico. The subsequent three games of Age of Empires III explored the early modern period, when Europe was colonizing the Americas and several Asian nations were on the decline. The newest installment, Age of Empires Online takes a different approach as a free-to-play online game utilizing Games for Windows Live. A spin-off game, Age of Mythology, was set in the same period as the original Age of Empires, but focused on fictional elements of Greek, Egyptian, and Norse mythology.

The popularity and quality of the games has earned Ensemble Studios a strong reputation in real-time strategy gaming.

Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings ;Real Time Strategy (RTS);09/30/99;Ensemble Studios;Microsoft Studios;"Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings (often shortened to AGE2, The Age of Kings, AoE II or AoK) is a real-time strategy (RTS) video game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft. Released in 1999 for the Microsoft Windows and Macintosh operating systems, it was the second game in the Age of Empires series. An expansion, The Conquerors, was released in 2000. A PlayStation 2 version was released by Konami in 2001, and a Nintendo DS spinoff, Age of Empires: The Age of Kings was developed by Backbone Entertainment in 2006. The Dreamcast port, by Konami, was canceled.

The Age of Kings is set in the Middle Ages and contains thirteen playable civilizations. They are the Britons, Byzantines, Celts, Goths, Teutons, Franks, Mongols, Chinese, Japanese, Persians, Saracens, Turks and the Vikings. Players aim to gather resources, which they use to build towns, create armies, and defeat their enemies. There are five historically-based campaigns, which constrict the player to specialized and story-backed conditions. There are three additional single player game modes, and multiplayer is supported. Despite using the same game engine and similar code to its predecessor, development of The Age of Kings took a year longer than expected, forcing Ensemble Studios to release Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome in 1998 instead. The design team focused on resolving significant issues in Age of Empires, but noted on release that some problems remained.

Reception of The Age of Kings was overwhelmingly positive, and the game scored highly on review aggregators. The significant number of new features was praised, as were the gameplay improvements. Some reviewers were critical of the presentation of units—they were seen as bland and uninteresting—while others considered The Age of Kings to be overly similar to its predecessor, Age of Empires. Three months after its release, two million copies of The Age of Kings had been shipped, and it topped sales charts in seven countries.

Allegiance ;Action Adventure;03/31/00;Microsoft Studios;Microsoft Studios;"Allegiance is a multiplayer online game providing a mix of real-time strategy and player piloted space combat gameplay. Initially developed by Microsoft Research, the game was later released under a shared source license in 2004  and is now maintained and developed by volunteers. 

The story in which the game is set takes place circa 2150, shortly after the destruction of Earth by an asteroid.   This cataclysm forced the remnants of humanity to the stars in search of new land and resources. Humanity quickly fractures into four main factions:

    The militaristic Iron Coalition, descendants of a United Nations-sanctioned peacekeeping force. 
    GigaCorp, a transplanetary corporation bent on controlling all natural resources. 
    Belters, a motley collection of traders, freedom fighters and pirates.
    and the Bios, a mysterious off shoot of genetically engineered humans with their own agenda for ""stalegenes"".

In the midst of the ensuing civil war, humans discover the alien Rixian Unity. An ancient and advanced race, the Rixians seek to ""enlighten"" heathen races (such as the human race) and convert them to their religion. 

Allegiance was first released for multiplayer on the Microsoft Zone under the name Allegiance Zone  . This was a paid subscription service but free play was available on the Free Zone (which had fewer features). The game never achieved commercial success however, selling a mere 29000 units in the first year of release  and the official servers closed in 2002. During its brief retail life Allegiance had drawn a dedicated following that continued to play beyond Microsoft's discontinuation of support for Allegiance.

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 ;Flight Simulation ;10/21/99;Microsoft Studios;Microsoft Studios;"Microsoft Flight Simulator (often abbreviated as MSFS or FS) is a series of flight simulator programs, marketed as a video game, for the Microsoft Windows operating system. It is one of the longest-running, best-known and most comprehensive home flight simulator programs on the market. It was an early product in the Microsoft application portfolio and differed significantly from Microsoft's other software which was largely business-oriented. At 25 years  it is the longest-running software product line for Microsoft, predating Windows by three years. Microsoft Flight Simulator may be the longest-running PC game series of all time.   In January 2009, it was reported by PCWorld that Microsoft closed down the ACES Game Studio, which was the department responsible for the creating and maintaining the flight simulator series.

Bruce Artwick began the development of the Flight Simulator in 1977. His company, subLOGIC, initially distributed it for various personal computers.  In 1981, Artwick was approached by Microsoft's Alan M. Boyd who was interested in creating a 'definitive game' that would graphically demonstrate the difference between older 8-bit computers such as the Apple II and the new 16-bit computers like the IBM PC still in development. In 1982, Artwick's company licensed a version of Flight Simulator for the IBM PC to Microsoft, which marketed it as Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.00.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0d/FS_logo.png;PC;http://www.microsoft.com/games/flight;E
Braid ;Action Adventure;04/10/09;Number None, Inc;Microsoft Studios;"Braid is a platform and puzzle video game developed by independent software developer Jonathan Blow. The game was released on August 6, 2008 for the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade service. A Microsoft Windows version was released on April 10, 2009. Hothead Games ported and released the game to Mac OS X on May 20, 2009 and the PlayStation Network on November 12, 2009. A Linux port, created by Ryan C. Gordon, was released December 14, 2010 as part of the second Humble Indie Bundle.

The basic story elements unfold as the protagonist, Tim, attempts to rescue a princess from a monster. Text passages laid throughout the game reveal a multifaceted narrative, giving clues about Tim's contemplations and motivations. The game features traditional aspects of the platform genre while integrating various powers of time-manipulation. Using these abilities, the player progresses by finding and assembling jigsaw puzzle pieces.

Blow designed the game as a personal critique of contemporary trends in game development. He funded the three-year project with his own money. Webcomic artist David Hellman drew the artwork, which underwent several iterations until it satisfied Blow's vision. A preliminary version of Braid without the final artwork won the ""Innovation in Game Design"" award at the 2006 Independent Games Festival; the final version received additional accolades. The game received highly positive reviews from critics, eventually becoming the highest critically rated title on Xbox Live. Some reviewers, however, criticized the game's price relative to its length.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6a/Braidlogo.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://braid-game.com/;T
LIMBO ;Action Adventure;08/02/11;Playdead ;Microsoft Studios;"Limbo (stylised as LIMBO) is a puzzle-platform video game and the premiere title of independent Danish game developer Playdead. The game was released in July 2010 as a platform exclusive title on Xbox Live Arcade, and was later re-released as part of a retail game pack along with Trials HD and 'Splosion Man in April 2011. Ports of the game to the PlayStation Network and Microsoft Windows via Steam and GamersGate were created by Playdead, released after the year-long Xbox 360 exclusivity period was completed. A Mac OS X version was released in December 2011. Limbo is a 2D sidescroller, incorporating the physics system Box2D to govern environmental objects and the player character. The player guides an unnamed boy through dangerous environments and traps as the boy searches for his sister. The developer built the game's puzzles expecting the player to fail before finding the correct solution. Playdead called the style of play ""trial and death"", and used visually gruesome imagery for the boy's deaths to steer the player from unworkable solutions.

The game is presented primarily in monochromatic black-and-white tones, using lighting, film grain effects and minimal ambient sounds to create an eerie atmosphere often associated with the horror genre. Journalists praised the dark presentation, describing the work as comparable to film noir and German Expressionism. Based on its aesthetics, reviewers classified Limbo as an example of ""video game as art"". Limbo received positive reviews, but its minimal story polarised critics; some critics found the open-ended work to have deeper meaning that tied well with the game's mechanics, while others believed the lack of significant plot and abrupt ending detracted from the game. A common point of criticism from reviewers was that the high cost of the game relative to its short length might deter players from purchasing the title, but some reviews proposed that Limbo had an ideal length.

Alan Wake ;Survival horror;02/16/12;Remedy Entertainment;Microsoft Studios;"Alan Wake is a third-person shooter psychological thriller action game developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Microsoft Game Studios. It was released for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. The story follows bestselling thriller novelist Alan Wake, as he tries to uncover the mystery behind his wife's disappearance during a vacation in the small fictional town of Bright Falls, Washington, all while experiencing events from the plot in his latest novel, which he cannot remember writing, coming to life.

In its pacing and structure, Alan Wake is similar to a thriller television series, with episodes that contain plot twists and cliffhangers. The game itself consists of six episodes, and the fiction is continued by two special episodes, titled ""The Signal"" and ""The Writer"", that were made available as downloadable content (DLC) within the same year of the game's release. Together, they make the first season of a possibly longer story. Additionally, a six-episode live-action web series called Bright Falls acts as a prequel to the game, and a number of related books also expand upon the Alan Wake story.

Chiefly written by Sam Lake, Alan Wake took over five years to create; an unusually long development time in the game industry. The game received positive reviews from critics, and is often revered for its narrative, pacing, and atmosphere. Alan Wake has been awarded the first spot in Time magazine's list of the top 10 video games of 2010. 

Alan Wake's American Nightmare, a full stand-alone title, was released in February 2012 on the Xbox Live Arcade service.  The game will not constitute a direct sequel to Alan Wake, and no plans have been announced for a sequel (or ""season two"") for the original game. Remedy have stated, however, that they are not yet done with Alan Wake.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d7/Alan-wake-0.jpg;PC, Xbox 360;http://www.alanwake.com/;

The game combines Arthurian lore, Norse mythology and Irish Celtic legends with a dash of high fantasy. It is set in the period after King Arthur's death and his kingdom has split into three parts which are in a constant state of war with each other.

DAoC includes both Player versus Environment (PvE) and Realm versus Realm (RvR) combat. Players can choose to adventure alone or join groups. Players may also join battlegroups, which are formed so all members are able to get completion of credit in large-scale PvE encounters and for communication purposes in RvR.

Player vs. Player combat takes the form of Realm versus Realm, a term which DAoC invented.  RvR is restricted to the zone New Frontiers where action ranges from massive battles to one vs one fights. Players are awarded realm points for each enemy realm player they kill. After gaining a certain number of realm points, a player gains a Realm Rank. While gaining Realm Ranks, a player gains Realm Ability Points, one for each rank you gain. Players are able to purchase with their realm abilities points certain skills unique to their class. Participating in RvR combat is strictly voluntary in DAoC and free-for-all PvP only exists on a dedicated server.

PvE focuses on defeating monsters found in dungeons, the open world, and RvR zones. Players earn experience points towards obtaining levels by killing both monsters and enemy players. Gaining levels yields new skills, abilities, and access to expansion areas. The current maximum level is 50. Expansions to the game offer alternative advancement type levels that grant additional abilities to level-50 players.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Dark_Age_of_Camelot_cover.jpg;PC;http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/;T

Prophecies introduced players to the world of Guild Wars, known as Tyria, and premiered several elements that are now known as core components of the Guild Wars games.

Like all Guild Wars campaigns, Prophecies contains a co-operative role-playing portion and a competitive Player versus Player (PvP) portion. Co-operative characters may be used in the competitive portion, or new PvP-specific characters may be created at maximum level and all skills unlocked to the accounts";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/Guildbox.jpg/250px-Guildbox.jpg;PC;http://www.guildwars.com/;T
Guild Wars 2 ;MMORPG;TBA;ArenaNet;NCsoft ;"Guild Wars 2 is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game in development by ArenaNet. Set in the fantasy world of Tyria, the game follows the re-emergence of Destiny's Edge, a disbanded guild dedicated to fighting the Elder Dragons, a Lovecraftian species that has seized control of Tyria in the time since the original Guild Wars. The game takes place in a persistent world with a story that progresses in instanced environments. 

Guild Wars 2 claims to be unique in the genre  by featuring a storyline that is responsive to player actions,  something which is common in single player role-playing games but rarely (if ever) seen in multiplayer ones. A dynamic event system replaces traditional questing, , utilising the ripple effect to allow players to approach quests in different ways as part of a persistent world. Also of note is the combat system, which aims to be more dynamic than its predecessor by promoting synergy between professions and using the environment as a weapon,   as well as reducing the complexity of the Magic-style skill system of the original game. As a sequel to Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2 will feature the same lack of subscription fees that distinguished its predecessor from other commercially developed online games of the time, though a purchase is still required to install the game";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Gw2-boxfront.png/250px-Gw2-boxfront.png;PC;http://www.guildwars2.com/en/;T
City of Heroes ;MMORPG;04/27/04;Cryptic Studios;NCsoft ;"City of Heroes (CoH) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game based on the superhero comic book genre, developed by Cryptic Studios and published by NCsoft. The game was launched in North America on April 27, 2004 and in Europe (by NCsoft Europe) on February 4, 2005 with English, German and French language servers. Twenty-one free major updates for City of Heroes have been released since its launch. The newest update, ""Convergence"", was released on September 13, 2011.

In the game, players create super-powered player characters that can team up with others to complete missions and fight criminals belonging to various gangs and organizations in the fictional Paragon City.

On October 31, 2005, the game's first sequel, City of Villains (CoV), was launched, allowing players to play as supervillains. Initially dubbed as an ""Expanshalone"" by the developers (a portmanteau of an expansion pack and stand-alone), the game did not require CoH to run, but if the user had both games, content was added to the CoH side of game play. On July 16, 2008, NCsoft merged the two games' content together, thus a player who only owned City of Heroes could now play City of Villains, and vice versa. Prior to this, a purchase was required to access either game's content, but they were linked by one account and subscription fee. 

On November 6, 2007, NCsoft announced their purchase of the CoH/CoV intellectual property and transitioned the staff from Cryptic Studios to a new location in Mountain View, CA to continue development of the game.  The new studio on April 14, 2009, became Paragon Studios, which shares credit with Cryptic Studios for the development work. This then led to City of Heroes becoming available for download on Steam, along with other NCsoft titles, on April 22, 2009. 

On October 30, 2008, NCsoft announced a partnership with Transgaming Technologies in order to bring both City of Heroes and City of Villains and all 13 expansions to Mac OS X. 

The expansion City of Heroes: Going Rogue's future release was announced on May 11, 2009. The game centers on the alternate reality of Praetoria and features a new alignment system allowing players characters to shift allegiances between Heroes and Villains, giving characters access to both the Paragon City of CoH and the Rogue Isles of CoV. Paragon Studios describes this as ""[exploring] the shades of gray that lay between Heroes and Villains"".   Going Rogue was released on August 17, 2010, with pre-purchasers able to play on August 16. 

On June 20, 2011, Paragon Studios announced that they were going to switch to a hybrid subscription model called City of Heroes: Freedom, adding in a free gameplay model, as well as special models for former subscribers termed Premium Players, and current subscribers become VIP players, who will gain access to all of the content in the various upcoming game updates";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/COHgamebox.jpg;PC;http://eu.cityofheroes.com/;T

Eurofighter Typhoon ;Flight simulator;07/30/01;Digital Image Design ;Rage Software ;"Eurofighter Typhoon is a combat flight simulator game modeling the jet fighter Eurofighter Typhoon. Digital Image Design was in process of developing the game when the company was bought by Rage Software. It was the successor to Total Air War.

One of the game most interesting aspects is that it entitles you to take over the destiny of 6 pilots. Each one will be assigned different missions depending on their abilities - such as bombing, interception, Wild Weasel - several of these missions even going on at the same time. You are able to switch at any time between your pilots, taking charge of the most critical and dangerous tasks of the mission, and leaving up to the AI the others. As the war goes on, each pilot can be injured, lost behind enemy lines after an unlucky ejection and waiting for the rescue helicopters, or taken prisoner and even be interrogated by the Russians.

The game also features a very extensive virtual battleground over Iceland, some of the most advanced created at the time. A dynamic camera enables you to watch the war in real-time - should it be Saab JAS 39 Gripen dogfighting with Sukhoi Su-27, Boeing AH-64 Apache attacking tanks or Panavia Tornado going on bombing runs. As the war unfolds, news will be delivered by an online newspaper, so be prepared to read the headline ""a new failure for the ICEFOR"" quite a lot of times.

The back story of the game posits Russia quickly invading the eastern countries of Europe. Iceland is the next one of the list, however NATO has basically abandoned the country in an attempt to protect the Western countries of Europe. The ICEFOR is outnumbered, but is able to deploy a small number of the new Typhoon aircraft. It's up to you to turn the tide of the war.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/97/Eurofighter_Typhoon_Coverart.png;PC;;T

Max Payne 3 ;First Person Shooter (FPS);05/29/12;Rockstar Vancouver;Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3 is an upcoming video game and the third title in the Max Payne franchise set to be published by Rockstar Games for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Development is led by Rockstar Vancouver in collaboration with the New England, London and Toronto studios.   This is the first game in the series not to be developed by Finnish game developer Remedy Entertainment and not being written by series creator Sam Lake.  The lead writer of Max Payne 3 is Dan Houser, who was also the writer of most games in the Grand Theft Auto series, and of Red Dead Redemption;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/21/Max_Payne_3_Cover.jpg/256px-Max_Payne_3_Cover.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://www.rockstargames.com/maxpayne3/;M
Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne ;First Person Shooter (FPS);10/14/03;Rockstar Vancouver;Rockstar Games;"Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a third-person shooter video game developed by Remedy Entertainment for Microsoft Windows and Rockstar Vienna for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 and published by Rockstar Games. The game is a sequel to Max Payne and is followed by Max Payne 3. It was released for Microsoft Windows on October 15, 2003, for Xbox on November 25, 2003, and for the PlayStation 2 on December 2, 2003.

In Max Payne 2, the player controls Max Payne, a detective for the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and a fugitive framed for murder in New York City at the end of Max Payne. Two years after the events of the first game, Max has cleared his name and is now an NYPD detective. He reunites with Mona Sax, whom he met in the previous game, as they set out to resolve a conspiracy of death and betrayal, finding the Inner Circle in the center of it all.

Video game critics gave Max Payne 2 generally favorable reviews. Praise focused on its action and story, while criticism targeted its short length. Despite the positive reception, the game sold poorly, leading Rockstar Games' parent company Take-Two Interactive to cite Max Payne 2's sales as a cause for the company's reforecasted finances of 2004. Max Payne 2 received several industry awards, including Outstanding Art Direction at the Golden Satellite Awards 2004, and Editors' Choice Awards from GamePro, IGN, and GameSpy.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/21/Max_Payne_2.jpg/256px-Max_Payne_2.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://www.rockstargames.com/maxpayne3/;M
L.A. Noire: The Complete Edition ;Adventure game;11/08/11;Team Bondi;Rockstar Games;"L.A. Noire (pronounced [ˌɛl ˌɛɪ ˈnwaʁ]) is a 2011 neo noir crime video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows.    L.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detective, to solve a range of cases across five crime desks.  Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the players' success at these activities will impact how much of the cases' stories are revealed.

The game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir, stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes including crime, sex, and moral ambiguity. The game uses a distinctive colouring-style, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black-and-white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of gum-shoe detective and mobster stories such as Key Largo, Chinatown,  The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.

L.A. Noire is notable for using Lightsprint's real-time global illumination technology, as well as Depth Analysis's newly developed technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle.   The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players must use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether they are lying or not.

L.A. Noire is the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival.   Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions have sold nearly 5 million copies combined.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3c/LA-Noire-Box-Art.jpg/250px-LA-Noire-Box-Art.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://www.rockstargames.com/lanoire;M

Empire: Total War ;Real Time Strategy (RTS);03/03/09;The Creative Assembly;Sega;"Empire: Total War is a turn-based strategy and real-time tactics computer game developed by The Creative Assembly and published by Sega. The fifth instalment in the Total War series, the game was released in North America on 3 March 2009, and in the rest of the world the following day. The game, which focuses on the early modern period of the 18th century, was announced at the Leipzig Games Convention in August 2007. The Mac OS X version of the game will be released by Feral Interactive. 

Following a similar style of interface and play to earlier Total War titles, players choose a contemporary 18th century faction and set out to ensure that faction's domination over the known world through military force, politics, diplomacy, espionage and economics. Although the campaign element of the game is turn-based, players can direct battles in real-time. Empire: Total War is the first game in the series to allow naval battles to be conducted in real-time. In addition to the standard campaign mode, the game includes a special campaign that follows the development of the United States from the settlement of Jamestown to the American War of Independence. Players may also engage in recreations of several historical battles from the early modern era.

Reviewers gave Empire: Total War a positive response upon release; several critics commended it as one of the foremost strategy titles of recent times. Praise was bestowed upon the extensive strategy breadth, accurate historical challenges and visual effects. The real-time land battles, with a far greater focus on gunpowder weaponry than earlier Total War titles, were thought to be successfully implemented. Criticisms focused on shortcomings with the game's artificial intelligence and on the real-time naval battles, the latter of which were perceived to be difficult to control and co-ordinate. The game was a commercial success, topping sales charts within the week of release; nevertheless, several Creative Assembly employees later commented on issues caused by a perceived early release.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/08/Empire_Total_War_cover_art.jpg;PC;http://www.sega.com/empire/;T

Players assume the role of Napoleon Bonaparte, or one of his major rivals, on a turn-based campaign map and engage in the subsequent battles in real-time. As with its predecessor, Empire: Total War, which included a special United States storyline, Napoleon features two special campaigns that follow the general's early career.

Napoleon received generally favorable reviews from video game critics. Reviews praised the game's stunning visuals, story driven campaigns, and new gameplay features. Some reviewers were critical of the game's weak AI, high system requirements, and its limited scope - while others considered Napoleon overly similar to Empire, its immediate predecessor in the series.

An entirely new campaign, the Peninsular Campaign, was released June 25, 2010 as downloadable content. It was later released in retail as part of the Empire and Napoleon Total War - Game of the Year Edition compilation pack on October 2, 2010.

Chris Taylor has described the plotline as introducing a moral dilemma regarding human cybernetic augmentation.[citation needed] Players have the choice to replace body parts with cybernetically enhanced components throughout the game, to more effectively counter the alien threat at the sacrifice of their humanity. However, the greatest bonus that comes near the end of the game (a 50% defence bonus) is only accessible if the player remains human.

Upon release, Condemned was met with moderate to good reviews by many aggregates and critics. Many reviewers cited its questionable storyline and lack of progression as the game's biggest fault. As a reprieve, the game's solid controls and fresh approach to the horror genre were praised. A sequel, entitled Condemned 2: Bloodshot, was released on March 11, 2008, for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Other media forms include an internet prequel and a planned film adaptation to expand the Condemned franchise.

Ground Control ;Real Time Strategy (RTS);05/31/00;Massive Entertainment ;Sierra Entertainment ;"Ground Control is a 2000 real-time tactics video game developed by Massive Entertainment. It features 3D graphics and a free-floating camera which allows one to zoom in and out and view the action from any angle, from a bird's-eye view to the perspective of one's own assault units at ground level. As a real-time tactics game, Ground Control completely does away with resource and economic management. One must therefore focus all attention on controlling a limited set of units to achieve victory.

Units in the game include various types of tanks, hovercraft, aircraft, and infantry, and are delivered to the battlefield by orbital dropships. However, once in battle, the player is not able to summon reinforcements, so proper troop selection between levels is a key to success. Each unit type has special weapons, abilities, and armor. Players can choose to customize each unit or let the game auto-select the load-out for each mission. The units of the two factions in the game differ in several areas: the Crayven Corporation has hardier units that rely on traditional ballistics and movement. The Order of the New Dawn's units trade heavy armor for a hover propulsion system that grants them increased speed and mobility, and use energy weaponry that give them more damage potential.

SWAT 3: Close Quarters Battle ;First Person Shooter (FPS);11/30/99;Sierra Entertainment;Sierra Entertainment ;"SWAT 3: Close Quarters Battle (also known as SWAT3 or SWAT3:CQB) is a tactical squad-based first-person shooter, developed by Sierra Northwest and published by Sierra Entertainment for Windows-based PCs on November 23, 1999. SWAT3 is the seventh installment of the long-running Police Quest series, and the third and biggest selling[citation needed] installment of the derived SWAT series, being the only member of the SWAT series to come close to the popularity of the earlier Police Quest titles[citation needed]. It is also the first game in the series to omit the phrase Police Quest from the full title.

As the first first-person shooter of the Police Quest/SWAT series, SWAT3 received a new game engine with cell and portal technologies for simulation of environments and advanced AI and ballistics. The developers spent some time consulting with LAPD SWAT, including a real-life SWAT element leader and LAPD SWAT founder Daryl F. Gates in order to create an accurate, realistic simulation.  Most of the animations in the game were motion captured from a real-life a SWAT officer.  Unlike many other first-person shooter games, SWAT3 places an emphasis on realistic police methods and tactics, including proper room clearance, use of less-lethal weaponry, ordering compliance and arresting enemies rather than shooting on sight, and differentiating between authorized and unauthorized use of lethal force.

SWAT3 is set in 2005 in Los Angeles, with the player assuming the role of a Los Angeles Police Department SWAT officer, leading a five-man element of computer-controlled teammates. Los Angeles is due to host a major, United Nations-brokered nuclear disarmament treaty signing attended by a number of world powers, including the United States, Russia and China. LAPD SWAT is tasked with protecting the treaty event and the attending dignitaries from a number of violent criminal and terrorist groups seeking to either abuse or disrupt the treaty signing event for their own ends, culminating in a direct nuclear threat to the City and an attack at the treaty signing event itself.

SWAT3 also includes a multiplayer mode, including traditional Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch modes, as well as Cooperative play through the single player missions.

SWAT3 was met by positive critical acclaim, attracting praise for its graphics and AI sophistication, and also spawned a successor, SWAT 4, released in April 2005, development and publishing being transferred to Irrational Games and Sierra owner Vivendi Universal.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/df/Swat3box.jpg/256px-Swat3box.jpg;PC;;T

Unlike the first Gabriel Knight game, released in 1993, The Beast Within was produced entirely in full motion video. The technology was popular at the time of the game's production with the recently introduced storage capabilities of CD-ROMs, but was expensive to produce and led to a linear storyline. The third Gabriel Knight game used a rendered 3D engine a few years later instead.

The game was released for PC and Macintosh. The Macintosh version used a video player developed by Sierra instead of an off-the-shelf technology such as Quicktime, and had a tendency to crash or run slowly on 680x0 processors.

Sierra On-Line eventually signed the game after expressing interest in making a 3D action game. The game had its first major public appearance at the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Designed for Windows, the game uses a heavily modified version of the Quake engine called GoldSrc.  

On its release, critics hailed its overall presentation and numerous scripted sequences, and it won over 50 PC Game of the Year awards.   Its gameplay influenced the design of first-person shooters for years after its release, and it is widely considered to be one of the greatest computer games of all time.   As of 16 November 2004, Half-Life sold eight million copies,  and 9.3 million copies by December 2008.  As of 14 July 2006, the Half-Life franchise has sold over 20 million units.  Half-Life was followed by the 2004 sequel Half-Life 2, which also received critical acclaim. Half-Life has had a notable cultural impact with its community mods and sequels spawning a large fanbase and cult following.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fa/Half-Life_Cover_Art.jpg/256px-Half-Life_Cover_Art.jpg;PC;http://store.steampowered.com/app/70;M

Realm of the Mad God ;Action Adventure;02/20/12;Wild Shadow Studios ;Spry Fox ;"Realm of the Mad God is a massively multiplayer browser game created by Wild Shadow Studios in partnership with Spry Fox, two independent developers. It has been in public beta since January 2010 and “officially” launched on June 20, 2011.  

The game was released on the Steam platform on February 20th, 2012. 

David Edery of Spry Fox describes the game as a ""massively cooperative bullet hell shooter"". 

Players control characters who have been transported to the realm of Oryx (the titular Mad God) to become food for his many minions, which the players must dispatch. When all of the high-level quest bosses are dispatched, Oryx will summon all player characters within his realm to his castle, divided into four ""groups"", depending on the amount of characters in the realm, where players must work together to defeat high-level enemies.

The player starts as a wizard, and unlocks additional classes upon reaching certain level requirements. Central to the design of the game is the fact that character death is permanent. Upon death, the player's character is lost along with all carried equipment, although the player may store a number of items for safekeeping in a vault.

The game is free to play, and both paying and non-paying players have access to the entire game. Additional vault chests and character slots can be purchased with real world money, as can various decorative items, including pets. No weapons, armor or other character enhancing equipment can be bought for real world money, giving paying players only a very limited advantage.

The Last Remnant ;Role Playing Game (RPG);03/24/09;Square Enix ;Square Enix ;"The Last Remnant (ラストレムナント Rasuto Remunanto?) is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix. The game is directed at both Japanese and Western audiences and had a simultaneous release in Japan, North America and Europe, on November 20, 2008 for the Xbox 360. The game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows at the end of March, 2009 and received an international release on the Steam network on April 9, 2009. A PlayStation 3 version of the game had been planned, but was never released. It is set in a fictional world divided into multiple city-states inhabited by four different species. The focus of the game's storyline is on ""Remnants"", mysterious and coveted ancient artifacts of varying shapes and sizes which possess magic powers, and a war sparked by a mysterious figure known as the Conqueror, as well as the search by Rush Sykes for his sister. The game features a unique battle system in which the player command multiple groups, or ""unions"", of characters rather than individual units.

The game was directed by Hiroshi Takai and was the first game developed by Square Enix to use the Unreal Engine 3. It was intended by Square Enix president Yoichi Wada to ""become a cornerstone for [their] worldwide strategy"".  Art direction was overseen by chief artist Kimihiko Miyamae and art producer Yusuke Naora. The game's soundtrack was composed by Tsuyoshi Sekito with assistance by Yasuhiro Yamanaka. It was later released as a three-disc album. The design and dialogue of the game were created to appeal to international players as well as Japanese players, and the motion capture for the main characters, including the lip-syncing, was done with Western, English-speaking actors.

The game received a weak reception by reviewers, though it was better received by Japanese reviewers than by Western ones. A common complaint, especially in the original Xbox 360 release, was of graphical problems including low framerates and ""texture pop-in"" where higher resolution textures would suddenly replace lower ones several seconds after a scene had started. Other issues included complaints about the game's storyline and battle system, though these were not as universal. The Last Remnant received praises for its art direction and music, and several review sites gave higher scores to the PC version of the game than the 360 version.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/32/The_Last_Remnant.jpg;PC, Xbox 360;http://lastremnant-game.com/;M

Super Meat Boy ;Action Adventure;11/30/10;Team Meat ;Steam;"Super Meat Boy is an independent video game designed by Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes and developed by Team Meat. It is the successor to McMillen and Jonathan McEntee's October 2008 Flash game Meat Boy. Super Meat Boy was released on the Xbox 360 through Xbox Live Arcade in October 2010, on Windows PCs in November 2010, on Mac OS X a year later in November 2011, and on Linux in December 2011 as a part of the Humble Indie Bundle #4. Players control Meat Boy, a red, cube-shaped character, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend, Bandage Girl, from the game's antagonist Dr. Fetus. The gameplay is characterized by fine control and split-second timing as the player runs and jumps through over 300 hazardous levels while avoiding obstacles. Additional player-created levels are available for free download.

Development of the game began in January 2009. McMillen worked on level design and artwork, while Refenes coded the game; it was tested primarily by the pair and their families. Initially intended for release in early 2010 for the PC and the WiiWare download service, the release date was pushed back as the design was changed to include more levels and exclude multiplayer modes. The WiiWare version was canceled due to the service's technical limitations. The music for the game was created by Danny Baranowsky, who had also composed the music for Meat Boy. The soundtrack has been released as an album, and music from it has been included in Rock Band 3.

The game was acclaimed by critics. In 2010, it received awards for Most Challenging Game from IGN, and for Best Downloadable Game from GameSpot and GameTrailers. Critics lauded the game's precise control, retro artwork, and soundtrack. Reviewers generally praised the game's challenge, although some warned that not all consumers would appreciate the level of difficulty. The game has been a commercial success, and has sold more than one million copies as of January 2012.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/aa/SuperMeatBoy_cover.png;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://www.supermeatboy.com/;T

It includes aspects of exploration, combat, diplomacy and trade. It is set in the same period as Sid Meier's Colonization, but involves more detailed colony management, with no ""Old World"" politics. Parts, like expansion and movement of resources, are similar to the early Settlers games. Anno 1602 is an economic, rather than combat, orientated strategy game. Players are rarely challenged in battle. The game design is noteworthy for its attempt to implement a 'progressive' artificial intelligence, meaning that the pace of the game changes in response to how quickly players act.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl ;First Person Shooter (FPS);03/20/07;GSC Game World;THQ;"S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a first-person shooter video game by the Ukrainian developer GSC Game World, published in 2007.

It features an alternate reality theme, where a second nuclear disaster occurs at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Exclusion Zone in the near future and causes strange changes in the area around it. The game has a non-linear storyline and features gameplay elements such as trading and two-way communication with NPCs. The game includes elements of role-playing video game and business simulation games[citation needed].

The background and some terminology of the game (""The Zone"", ""Stalker"") is borrowed from the popular science fiction novella Roadside Picnic by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky and the 1979 Andrei Tarkovsky film Stalker that was loosely based on it, as well as Stalker, the film's subsequent novelization by the original authors. The term ""Stalkers"" was originally used for the scientists and engineers who explored the interior of Chernobyl's ""sarcophagus"" after its hasty construction in 1986. 

In S.T.A.L.K.E.R, the player assumes the identity of an amnesiac ""Stalker"", an illegal explorer/artifact scavenger in ""The Zone"", dubbed ""The Marked One"". ""The Zone"" is the location of an alternate reality version of the Zone of alienation surrounding the Chernobyl Power Plant after a second, fictitious meltdown, which further contaminated the surrounding area with radiation and caused strange otherworldly changes in local fauna, flora and the laws of physics. ""Stalker"" in the context of the film refers to the older meaning of the word as a tracker and hunter of game or guide.

On July 11, 2007, GSC Game World announced a prequel, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky, which was released on 5 September 2008.  On April 30, 2009, GSC Game World announced a sequel, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat, which was released worldwide in February 2010. 

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. stands for ""Scavenger, Trespasser, Adventurer, Loner, Killer, Explorer, Robber""";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b3/Shadow_of_Chernobyl_cover.jpg/256px-Shadow_of_Chernobyl_cover.jpg;PC;http://www.stalker-videogame.com/;M

The aerial combat is drawn from the Battle of Britain during the Second World War and features the British RAF versus the German Luftwaffe. Due to its emphasis on historical accuracy, Wings of Victory remains very popular among serious PC historical World War II flight sim enthusiasts. The release was met with many favorable reviews, and won several awards including the SimHQ Best of 2006 award. 

Battle of Britain II can be played either as a flight simulator or as a strategy game, or both combined. It allows the player to assume the role of pilot in the flight simulator, and/or the Commander of the Air Force - managing tactics in the strategy game. The player can choose either side, the RAF or the Luftwaffe. Changes from Rowan's original BoB title include an extensive graphics overhaul, gameplay tweaks and numerous new features. Its broad scope includes hundreds of warplanes and huge aerial raids and battles in the air. The simulation has realistic AA fire, radio traffic, and in-game ambiance that includes military forces on the ground. Due to the high level of detail and historical accuracy, the flight sim developers term Battle of Britain II: Wings of Victory their ""time machine"". The flight simulation engine (code) used in this product is called the ""Merlin"" engine, which is an advanced proprietary Air-Combat computer game engine designed by A2A Simulations and first released in their Battle of Britain II: Wings of Victory title.

A2A Simulations Forum announced a sequel to be called Flying Tigers  but no firm dates have been set as of yet for release. As of February, 2008 it was still considered ""in development"".

A modified version of the game with arcade-style gameplay was published by Wild Hare Entertainment under the title Air Battles: Sky Defender in 2007.

Following its unveiling at E3 2011, Brothers in Arms: Furious 4 has presented itself as a casualized sequel to the Brothers in Arms titles, taking a very different approach to its World War II subject matter. Instead of portraying a realistic take on war focusing on Staff Sgt. Matt Baker of the 101st Airborne Division, this new game follows four zany characters of a yet unnamed unit on a fictional romp through Germany after Hitler himself.

While the announcement CGI trailer immediately garnered comparisons to Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds, recent previews of Gearbox's E3 game play demo describe the game as an insane combination of the studio's previous hit Borderlands and the recent arcade shooter Bulletstorm by People Can Fly and Epic Games.

Gearbox has stated that their Brothers in Arms brand is more than just Baker and the 101st, and that Furious 4 does not represent a 'reboot' that would preempt the Baker series of games. At the recent Gearbox Community Day, Creative Director Mikey Neumann promised that fans would still see the final chapter in Matt Baker's story.

The four protagonists are Chok, a Native American soldier who uses hatchets to dispatch enemies; Montana, a large lumberjack turned Nazi slayer who wields a chain gun; Crockett, a Texas native who uses a cattle iron to brand fallen enemies; and Stitch, a mentally unstable Irishman who shocks enemies with a custom made taser.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8f/BIA_Furious_4_logo.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://www.brothersinarmsgame.com/;M

World in Conflict: Soviet Assault ;Real Time Strategy (RTS);03/10/09;Massive Entertainment;Ubisoft;"World in Conflict: Soviet Assault is an expansion pack developed by Massive Entertainment and Swordfish Studios for the real-time tactics video game World in Conflict. It features the ability to play as the Soviet Union in the single player campaign, against which the player fought in the original World in Conflict as well as adding additional multiplayer maps. 

The game is set in an alternate 1989 in which the Politburo of the Soviet Union elects to take military action to sustain itself, rather than collapse. Failing to achieve aid diplomatically, the Soviet Union invades Western Europe. However, in addition to the standard US campaign, the player also assumes the role of Romanov, a Lieutenant in the Soviet Army under the command of Colonel Vladimir Orlovsky. Orlovsky also commands two other subordinates in his battalion, his nephew Captain Nikolai Malashenko and old friend Major Valeriy Lebedjev, a KGB officer attached to the battalion. The expansion adds a total of six Soviet missions interspersed between the original game's missions, thus completing the story and acting as an update for the campaign while retaining the original game's units and features.

The World In Conflict Complete Edition and stand alone Soviet Assault Expansion Pack were released in the United States on March 10, 2009 and later on in Europe and Australia on March 12, 2009.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/World_in_Conflict_Soviet_Assault.jpg;PC;http://www.worldinconflict.com/;T

Will Rock ;First Person Shooter (FPS);06/09/03;Saber Interactive ;Ubisoft;"Will Rock is a first-person shooter released in North America on June 9 and Europe on June 13, 2003. This first game, developed on the Saber 3D engine, by Saber Interactive and published by Ubisoft, did not receive huge media attention, but did polarize reviewers who ran the gamut with scores of 90s down to 20s,  and some likened the title to a poorer version of Serious Sam. 

In Rock, the player takes on the persona of the title character Willford Rockwell, an archeology student, who is faced with the aftermath of a fanatical group called the Olympian Restoration Army (ORA), who somehow have managed to bring back to life a host of mythological creatures from Ancient Greece, including Zeus, king of the Gods, who has abducted Will's girlfriend Emma. Will is recruited by Prometheus, the Greek Titan of fire and craft, to destroy Zeus and his minions—and rescue his girlfriend.

There are ten levels in the single player and coop versions. Many reviewers noted the massive numbers of enemies, prompting IGN to remark that it ""elevates the experience to a kind of inspired lunacy.""  At some points in the game it is possible to be attacked by dozens of different types of enemies simultaneously, and some creatures, such as axe-throwing minotaurs, split into two more attackers when ""killed"". Balancing this is the player's arsenal; among the weapons at his disposal are acid, atomic and ""Medusa"" guns, and the more standard pistol, shotgun, crossbow, fireball thrower, minigun and grenades. A shovel is also included as a melee weapon.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2c/Will_Rock_Coverart.png;PC;;M

The story of the game takes place during the time of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter. H.A.W.X is set in the near future where private military companies have essentially replaced government-run military in many countries. The player is placed in the shoes of David Crenshaw — an ex-military elite pilot who was recruited by one of these corporations to work for them as one of their pilots, fighting whomever and whenever he is told to. Crenshaw later returns to the US Air Force together with his team, trying to prevent a full scale terrorist attack on the United States which was initiated by this military company.

A demo of the game for the Xbox 360 was released on February 11, 2009, PlayStation 3 on February 27, 2009 and Microsoft Windows on March 2, 2009.

Silent Hunter II ;Simulate;11/05/01;Aeon Electronic Entertainment;Ubisoft ;"Silent Hunter II is a WWII U-boat combat simulation from Ubisoft for Windows 95/98/ME. It was originally being developed by Aeon Electronic Entertainment, the developers of Silent Hunter, but they had to leave the project unfinished, and Ultimation Inc. finished it. After considerable delays it was released in November 2001.  Silent Hunter II gives the player the command of a U-boat during the Second Battle of the Atlantic. The game offers single-player and multiplayer missions.  In addition to some separate single-player missions, they also come as a string in the theme of ""U-boat highlights"", allowing the player to re-experience such well-known adventures as U-47's penetration into Scapa Flow, passing through the Strait of Gibraltar and Operation Drumbeat against American shipping.  German World War II veteran and sub commander Erich Topp was one of the game's technical advisers.   What made Silent Hunter II into a revolutionary concept was that it was not only playable on-line with or against other U-boats, but also against destroyers that were controlled by players of Destroyer Command, a title also released by Ubisoft.  However, the reception was not enthusiastic among the fans of Silent Hunter. Silent Hunter II was criticised for a crude AI, the lack of a replayable single player career against the limited collection of missions and the fail-prone multiplayer mode, which often disconnected players before the action had even started.  To fix and enhance the multiplayer mode, an unofficial (authorized by Ubisoft) patch called Projekt Messerwetzer was worked up by Subsim.com.  Also, to revive a once disappointing title, several fan-made modifications and missions have emerged.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/eb/Silent_Hunter_II_cover.jpg;PC;http://www.silenthunterii.com/;E

Shadowbane ;MMORPG;03/25/03;Wolfpack Studios ;Ubisoft ;"Shadowbane was a free fantasy role-playing video game (MMORPG) created by Wolfpack Studios and published on March 25, 2003 by Ubisoft for Windows and Mac platforms. Originally commercial and subscription-driven, Shadowbane was launched in March 2003, and was the creation of text-MUD veterans J. Todd Coleman, James Nance, Josef Hall, Patrick Blanton and Robert Marsa and a team of 45 programmers, designers, artists and featured music by composer David Beaupre. It closed on July 1, 2009.

Shadowbane was a top-10 best selling PC game at launch, and was noted for two things. First, the majority of the game world allowed for open Player versus player combat, making it an early pioneer title in the PvP MMO genre. Second, it was the first major MMO to offer dynamic world content as a primary feature of the game. Most MMOs are static, meaning the world itself does not change based on player actions. Dynamic worlds allow player to change the game world itself; morphing terrain, building and destroying buildings and fortifications, and setting up patrol paths for player-hired AI combatants. The game was considered a ""cult hit"" and sustained a small base of followers, but technical issues plagued the game at launch and failed to retain much of the early fanbase shortly after launch.

After the sale of Wolfpack Studios to Ubi Soft in March 2004, the live service was transitioned to a new management and (largely new) development team, led by Frank Lucero and Ala Diaz. This team later splintered off to become Stray Bullet Games in June 2006, and Mark Nuasha was brought in to run the organization. Since March 15, 2006 the game has been freeware and free-to-play. A system of short ads was introduced on March 6, 2007 to fund operating costs, which are displayed when the game is opened or closed and when a character dies (with at least 10 minutes between death ads).  On March 19, 2008, all servers were closed to prepare for the ""Shadowbane Reboot,"" a relaunching of the game to capitalize on stability and performance gains hindered by previously existing data.  All player characters and cities were deleted in this reboot. On March 25, 2008, the 5th anniversary of the game's launch, two servers were brought online followed by a third due to overpopulation. 

The regular game took place in a dark fantasy world called Aerynth (the world will sometimes depend on the servers, many of which have unique world maps). Gameplay features many aspects typical of role-playing video games, such as experience points, character classes, and fantasy races.

Developed by Valve Corporation, it was initially released on November 16, 2004, following a protracted five-year,  $40 million development cycle,  during which a substantial part of the project was leaked and distributed on the Internet. 

The game was developed alongside Source and Steam. It introduced the Source game engine and, because of Steam, is the first video game to require online product activation.  

Like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 was met with near-unanimous critical acclaim.   It was praised for its advanced physics, animation, sound, AI, graphics, and narrative. The game won 39 ""Game of the Year"" awards,  and several publications have named it ""Game of the Decade"".     Over 6.5 million copies of Half-Life 2 were sold at retail by December 3, 2008, making it a bestselling PC game.  This figure does not include the significant number of sales through Steam.

Left 4 Dead 2 ;First Person Shooter (FPS);11/17/09;Valve Corporation;Valve Corporation;"Left 4 Dead 2 is a cooperative first-person shooter video game. It is the sequel to Valve Corporation's award-winning Left 4 Dead. The game launched on November 17, 2009, for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 in the United States and November 20 in Europe; in 2010, Left 4 Dead 2 was made available to the Steam client for Mac OS X.  It builds upon the cooperatively-focused gameplay of the original and uses Valve's proprietary Source engine, the same game engine used in Left 4 Dead. The game made its world premiere at E3 2009 with a trailer during the Microsoft press event. 

Like the original, Left 4 Dead 2 is set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, and focuses on four survivors fighting against hordes of the infected, who develop severe psychosis and exhibit zombie-like tendencies. The survivors must fight their way through levels, interspersed with safe houses that act as checkpoints, with the goal of reaching a rescue vehicle at the campaign's finale. The gameplay is procedurally altered by an artificial intelligence engine dubbed the ""Director"" that monitors the players' performance and adjusts the scenario to provide a dynamic challenge. Several new features have been introduced: new types of infected, melee weapons, and a story-arc that connects the game's five campaigns together. 

When it was released, it received a combination of positive and negative critical and community reactions. It attracted an unusually high volume of pre-release controversy about the game's graphic content. In response, alterations were made to the cover art  and both Australia (due to having no R18+ rating) and Germany refused to rate the unmodified edition.  After release however, the game was met with critical acclaim and positive reviews.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Left4Dead2.jpg/250px-Left4Dead2.jpg;PC, Xbox 360;http://www.l4d.com/;M
Left 4 Dead ;First Person Shooter (FPS);11/18/08;Valve Corporation;Valve Corporation;"Left 4 Dead is a cooperative first-person shooter video game. It was developed by Turtle Rock Studios, which was purchased by Valve Corporation during development. The game uses Valve's proprietary Source engine, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and Mac OS X. Development on the game was completed on November 13, 2008, and two versions were released digitally: A downloadable digital version, released on November 17, 2008, and a digital retail disc version, with a release date determined by region. The digital retail disc version was released in North America and Australia on November 18, 2008; and in Europe and Japan on November 21, 2008.

Set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, the game pits its four protagonists—dubbed the ""Survivors""—against hordes of the infected. There are four game modes: a single-player mode in which allied characters are controlled by AI; a four-player, co-op campaign mode; an eight-player online versus mode; and a four-player survival mode. In all modes, an artificial intelligence (AI), dubbed the ""Director"", controls level pacing and item placements, in an attempt to create a dynamic experience and increase replay value.

Left 4 Dead was well received by the industry media upon its release, with praise given for its replay value, focus on cooperative play, and movie-like experience. Several criticisms were aimed at limited level selection and the lack of a narrative. The game has won several publication awards, as well as distinctions from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and British Academy of Film and Television Arts. As was done with Team Fortress 2, Valve plans on supplementing the game with free downloadable content. The first of these, called the ""Survival Pack"", was released on April 21, 2009. The second piece of DLC was charged for via Xbox Live and came in the form of a new Campaign entitled ""Crash Course,"" released for both the PC and Xbox 360 on September 29, 2009.

The popularity of the game led to the development of a sequel, Left 4 Dead 2, which was released November 17, 2009. Left 4 Dead 2 was released on Mac OS X via Steam on October 5, 2010, and the original Left 4 Dead was released for the Mac soon after on October 28, 2010. The Mac version of Left 4 Dead 2 incorporated a new map for both Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, called ""The Sacrifice"", as well as ""No Mercy"" being imported into Left 4 Dead 2, allowing for cross-platform support between Windows and Mac versions.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5b/Left4Dead_Windows_cover.jpg/252px-Left4Dead_Windows_cover.jpg;PC, Xbox 360;http://www.l4d.com/;M
Team Fortress 2 ;First Person Shooter (FPS);10/10/07;Valve Corporation;Valve Corporation;"Team Fortress 2 is a free-to-play team-based first-person shooter multiplayer video game developed by Valve Corporation. A sequel to the original mod Team Fortress based on the Source engine, it was first released as part of the video game compilation The Orange Box on October 10, 2007 for Windows and the Xbox 360.  A PlayStation 3 version then followed on November 22, 2007.  The game was later released as a standalone package for Windows on April 9, 2008, and for Mac OS X two years later. Team Fortress 2 is distributed online through the Steam system, while retail distribution was handled by Electronic Arts. On June 23, 2011, the game became a free-to-play title, supported by microtransactions for unique in-game equipment through Steam. The development of Team Fortress 2 is led by John Cook and Robin Walker, the designers who originally created the Team Fortress modification for Quake in 1996.

The game was announced in 1998, powered by Valve's GoldSrc engine, but has since been through various concepts and designs. In 1999, the game appeared to be deviating from its predecessors by pursuing a more realistic and militaristic style of gameplay, but the design metamorphosed over its nine-year development period. The final rendition sports cartoon style visuals influenced by the art of J. C. Leyendecker, Dean Cornwell and Norman Rockwell  and is powered by the Source engine. The game itself revolves around two teams, each with access to nine distinct characters, battling in a variety of game modes set in different environments, often with a factory-warehouse theme.

The lack of information or apparent progress for six years of the game's original development caused it to be labeled as vaporware, and it was regularly featured in Wired News' annual vaporware list among other ignominies.  Upon its release, the game received critical acclaim and several awards, being praised for its graphical style,  balanced gameplay,  comedic value  and for its use of full character personalities in a dedicated multiplayer only game.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/Tf2_standalonebox.jpg/250px-Tf2_standalonebox.jpg;PC, PS 3, Xbox 360;http://teamfortress.com/;M

In addition, Day of Defeat: Source has been used by Valve to present new design features on the Source engine, such as high dynamic range rendering and cinematic effects. The game itself revolves around two teams, the US Army and the German Wehrmacht, each with access to six player classes, fighting in a variety of scenarios inspired by World War II engagements in the European Theatre of 1944.

Portal 2 ;First Person Shooter (FPS);04/19/11;Valve Corporation ;Valve Corporation ;"Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle-platform video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. It is the sequel to Portal (2007) and was released on April 18, 2011 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The retail versions of the game are distributed by Electronic Arts, while digital distribution of the Windows and OS X versions is handled by Valve's content delivery service Steam. Portal 2 was announced on March 5, 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game. The sequel's release on Steam was preceded by a second multi-week alternate reality game, the Potato Sack, involving 13 independently-developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof to release Portal 2 several hours early.

Like its predecessor, Portal 2 primarily comprises a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using the ""portal gun"", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The game's physics allow momentum to be retained through these portals, which must be used creatively to maneuver through the game's challenges. In addition to retaining most of the original Portal's gameplay elements, the sequel added new features, including tractor beams, laser redirection, bridges made of light, and paint-like gels that impart special properties to surfaces. These gels were created by the team from the Independent Games Festival-winning DigiPen student project Tag: The Power of Paint.

Within the single player campaign, the player returns as the human Chell, having awakened from stasis after many years. Chell must navigate the now-dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center and its test chambers with the portal gun while the facility is rebuilt by the reactivated GLaDOS, an artificially intelligent computer that appeared in Portal. The storyline is longer than that of Portal's and introduced new characters, including the A.I. Wheatley, voiced by Stephen Merchant, and recordings of the deceased Aperture Science CEO Cave Johnson, voiced by J. K. Simmons. Ellen McLain reprised the role of GLaDOS. Jonathan Coulton and The National produced one song each for the game. Portal 2 also includes a two-player co-operative mode, in which the robotic player-characters Atlas and P-Body are each given a portal gun and are required to work together to solve test chambers specifically designed to require cooperation. Valve provided post-release support for the game, including additional downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share test chambers with others.

Though many reviewers were initially concerned about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel, critics universally praised Portal 2. The game's writing, pacing, and humor were highlighted as stand-out elements, with critics applauding the voice work of McLain, Merchant, and Simmons. Reviews also highlighted the new gameplay elements, the game's challenging but surmountable learning curve, and the additional co-operative mode. Numerous gaming journalists ranked Portal 2 among the top games of 2011, including several naming it their Game of the Year.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f9/Portal2cover.jpg;PC, Xbox 360, PS 3;http://www.thinkwithportals.com/;T

A Mac OS X version was released as part of the Mac-compatible Steam platform on May 12, 2010. 

The game primarily comprises a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using ""the handheld portal device"", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The player-character, Chell, is challenged by an artificial intelligence named GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed. The game's unique physics allows momentum to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of portals to maneuver through the test chambers. This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game Narbacular Drop; many of the team members from the DigiPen Institute of Technology who worked on Narbacular Drop were hired by Valve for the creation of Portal.

Portal was acclaimed as one of the most original games of 2007, despite being considered short in length. The game received praise for its unique gameplay and darkly humorous story. It received acclaim for the character of GLaDOS, voiced by Ellen McLain in the English-language version, and the end credits song ""Still Alive"" written by Jonathan Coulton for the game. Not counting sales through Steam, over four million copies of the game have been sold since its release. The game's popularity has led to official merchandise from Valve including plush Companion Cubes, as well as fan recreations of the cake and portal gun.

The aerial combat is drawn from the Battle of Britain during the Second World War and features the British RAF versus the German Luftwaffe. Due to its emphasis on historical accuracy, Wings of Victory remains very popular among serious PC historical World War II flight sim enthusiasts. The release was met with many favorable reviews, and won several awards including the SimHQ Best of 2006 award. 

Battle of Britain II can be played either as a flight simulator or as a strategy game, or both combined. It allows the player to assume the role of pilot in the flight simulator, and/or the Commander of the Air Force - managing tactics in the strategy game. The player can choose either side, the RAF or the Luftwaffe. Changes from Rowan's original BoB title include an extensive graphics overhaul, gameplay tweaks and numerous new features. Its broad scope includes hundreds of warplanes and huge aerial raids and battles in the air. The simulation has realistic AA fire, radio traffic, and in-game ambiance that includes military forces on the ground. Due to the high level of detail and historical accuracy, the flight sim developers term Battle of Britain II: Wings of Victory their ""time machine"". The flight simulation engine (code) used in this product is called the ""Merlin"" engine, which is an advanced proprietary Air-Combat computer game engine designed by A2A Simulations and first released in their Battle of Britain II: Wings of Victory title.

A2A Simulations Forum announced a sequel to be called Flying Tigers  but no firm dates have been set as of yet for release. As of February, 2008 it was still considered ""in development"".

A modified version of the game with arcade-style gameplay was published by Wild Hare Entertainment under the title Air Battles: Sky Defender in 2007.

Magic: The Gathering Online ;Puzzle game;06/14/02;Wizards of the Coast ;Wizards of the Coast ;"Magic: The Gathering Online (MTGO) or Magic Online is a direct video game adaptation of Magic: The Gathering, utilizing the concept of a virtual economy in order to preserve the collectible aspect of the card game.  It is played through an Internet service operated by Wizards of the Coast, which went ""live"" on 24 June 2002.  Users can play the game or trade cards with other users. It is only officially available for the Microsoft Windows operating system.

As of February 2007, Magic Online has over 300,000 registered accounts;  however this does not represent the true number of players, since people are allowed to register multiple accounts. At different times during the day and night, Magic Online hosts on average 2,000-4,000 simultaneously logged in accounts. According to Wizards of the Coast, Magic Online is ""somewhere between 30% to 50% of the total Magic business.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6b/MTGOboxart.jpg;PC;http://www.wizards.com/magic/digital/MagicOnline.aspx;T
Syberia II ;Adventure game;03/30/04;Microïds ;XS Games ;"Syberia II is a 2004 adventure game conceived by Benoît Sokal and developed by MC2-Microïds, and a continuation to Syberia. It is a third-person puzzle-solving game. Stylistically identical to the first Syberia, Syberia II improves upon the first game by introducing more realistic character animation. The game includes a recap of the first chapter, so therefore does not require the player to have experienced the first game.

Sokal's later adventure games, such as Sinking Island and Paradise have no connections to Syberia but do use the same high quality artwork and a similar interface.

In 2009 Microïds announced that Syberia III would be released on PC and PlayStation 3 in 2010 or 2011. As of 2012 there has been no release or further announcements regarding a possible Syberia III.";http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0d/Syberia2.jpg/256px-Syberia2.jpg;PC, PS 2.

The main character is 18-year old Yukari Fujisawa, a feminine-looking Japanese boy who has never had sex with a girl. He starts working as a waiter in a membership restaurant named Platinum where all the girls who work there wear sexy bunny suits. Soon he finds that other waitresses, including his cousin Sae Ishigami, have very unusual sexual tendencies.

The game features the original Japanese voices along with an English translation and is 100% uncensored.
