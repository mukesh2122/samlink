It was founded in 1996, when Wing Commander creator Chris Roberts left Origin Systems, Inc., along with Erin Roberts, Eric Peterson, John Miles, Tony Zurovec and many other employees.

According to Chris Roberts, Digital Anvil was created to bring back the ""small-team"" element that characterized the computer gaming industry throughout the 1980s. Four titles were initially announced: Conquest: Frontier Wars, a Command & Conquer-style game set in space; Loose Cannon, a racing game similar to the later Driver and Grand Theft Auto games; Starlancer, a space combat game in the Wing Commander tradition, and the company's flagship, Freelancer, an ambitious unofficial follow up to Wing Commander: Privateer.

The first game to be released by Digital Anvil was Starlancer, developed in partnership with Warthog Games. It was, released by Microsoft to very solid reviews, and overall sales were decent with around 700,000 units sold.

Digital Anvil was purchased by Microsoft on 5 Dec 2000.  One of the consequences of this action was a reshuffling of titles being developed. Conquest: Frontier Wars and Loose Cannon were dropped by the company, eventually being picked up by Ubisoft Entertainment. Conquest was eventually released in 2001, but Loose Cannon has not yet been released and it remains doubtful it ever will be. Many of the Digital Anvil staff working on Loose Cannon were reassigned to the company's flagship Freelancer. Brute Force (still unannounced at the time) was switched from a computer game to an Xbox exclusive. Of all the projects being produced, only Freelancer escaped major change. Co-founder Chris Roberts left the company after the Microsoft takeover, but he still worked as a consultant on Freelancer.

Digital Anvil also made the visual effects of the 1999 film Wing Commander (see imdb: Wing Commander (1999) under ""Visual Effects by"", also in the film's credits).

For the next year, Digital Anvil was mostly silent, and many wondered whether any games from the company would see the light of day. Then, in 2001, Digital Anvil revealed a lighter Freelancer to the gaming press. Although some of the more ambitious elements were dropped, this act proved Freelancer was not vaporware.

In March 2003, Freelancer was released and immediately became one of the month's top-selling games. Reviews were mixed, but the game did well commercially. In May of the same year, Digital Anvil released Brute Force for the Xbox. The game also did quite well, setting first-month sales records for Xbox games.

In November 2005, Microsoft redeployed the developer's employees to its Microsoft Game Studios headquarters. Digital Anvil was officially dissolved on January 31, 2006. 

Key staff from Digital Anvil then teamed up together with staff from Warthog Games (Now known as Gizmondo) to form Embryonic Studios, which was later acquired by TT Games in 2007 to become TT Fusion."

Company which was a subsidiary of Sierra Online, which developed games which were outside of what was expected from Sierra at the time.  For instance, its point and click adventure games differed from Sierra's, often having a grittier, more adult-oriented style with arcade sequences mixed in, as well as innovative if sometimes not fully realized changes to expected formulae, such as branching plots and calendar-based puzzles. 

Damon Slye and co. created Arctic Fox, the RPG Betrayal at Krondor, and Starsiege, and were often second-party developers for other existing franchises, including Space Quest V, a continuation of Sierra's famous adventure series.

Electronic Arts;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/21/Ealogo.svg/200px-Ealogo.svg.png;5/28/1982;Redwood City, California, United States;Public;9158;http://www.ea.com/;Publisher;"Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA) is a major American developer, marketer, publisher and distributor of video games. Founded and incorporated on May 28, 1982 by Trip Hawkins, the company was a pioneer of the early home computer games industry and was notable for promoting the designers and programmers responsible for its games. It is one of the largest video game publishers in the world.

Originally, EA was a home computing game publisher. In the late 1980s, the company began developing games in-house and supported consoles by the early 1990s. EA later grew via acquisition of several successful developers. By the early 2000s, EA had become one of the world's largest third-party publishers. On May 4, 2011, EA reported $3.8 billion in revenues for the fiscal year ending March 2011, and on January 13, 2012, EA announced that it had exceeded $1 billion in digital revenue during the previous calendar year.  In a note to employees, EA CEO John Riccitiello called this “an incredibly important milestone” for the company.  EA began to move toward direct distribution of digital games and services with the acquisition of the popular online gaming site Pogo.com in 2001.  In 2009, EA acquired the London-based social gaming startup Playfish,  and in June 2011, EA launched Origin, an online service to sell downloadable games directly to consumers.  In July 2011, EA announced that it had acquired PopCap Games, the company behind hits such as Plants vs. Zombies and Bejeweled. 

EA continued its shift toward digital goods in 2012, folding its mobile-focused EA Interactive (EAi) division ""into other organizations throughout the company, specifically those divisions led by EA Labels president Frank Gibeau, COO Peter Moore, and CTO Rajat Taneja, and EVP of digital Kristian Segerstrale."" 

EA is currently the No. 1 publisher in Western markets with a 16% segment share,  and the second-largest social games company on Facebook. EA's rankings have been propped up by the launch of The Sims Social, which is currently the fastest-growing game on Facebook. 

On May 4, 2011, EA reported $3.8 billion in revenues for the fiscal year ending March 2011. On July 27, 2011, EA reported fiscal first-quarter profits had more than doubled on brisk sales of ""highly-anticipated sports and shooter games"".  EA earned $221 million, or 66 cents a share, in the three months that ended June 30. ""That's up from earnings of $96 million, or 29 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 23 percent to $999 million from $815 million."" 

EA’s earnings are marked by an ongoing difference between non-GAAP and GAAP accounting – which, for example, mandates deferrals of revenue related to services provided for online-enabled packaged goods and digital content. Consequently, EA’s quarterly reports reflect hundreds of millions of dollars which, under GAAP accounting, are deferred for a period of months – then appear in the earnings over multiple quarters subsequent to the original sale. Other companies with significant online revenues face similar issues. This can make it extremely difficult to understand the company’s GAAP profitability.

Currently, EA develops and publishes games under several labels including EA Sports titles, Madden NFL, FIFA Soccer, NHL, NCAA Football, SSX and NBA Jam. Other EA labels produce established franchises such as Battlefield, Need for Speed, The Sims, Medal of Honor, Command & Conquer, as well as newer franchises such as Dead Space, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Army of Two and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, produced in partnership with LucasArts.  EA also owns and operates major gaming studios in Tiburon in Orlando, Burnaby, Vancouver, Montreal and DICE in Sweden."

The company was founded in 1998 by Demis Hassabis, formerly a prominent figure at Lionhead Studios. At its height, it employed around sixty people, and was based in London. It aimed to be an independent developer, creating its own intellectual properties rather than licencing established ones. The company's first game, Republic: The Revolution, was released in 2003, and a second game, Evil Genius, was released in 2004.

In 2005, however, the company announced that it would be closing its doors. This followed the cancellation of development on a major project due to its ""perceived high-risk"", which had been underway for two years. The company, citing ""the current risk averse publishing climate"", concluded that its goal of exploring new territory was not possible. In a press release, Hassabis said: ""It seems that today's games industry no longer has room for small independent developers wanting to work on innovative and original ideas. ... [T]his was the sole purpose of setting up Elixir and something we could never compromise on."" Elixir has stated that it has sufficient resources to pay redundancy packages to its staff and ensure that the company is wound down in an orderly manner.

Fueled by past publishing experiences and frustrations, several experienced development companies bound together to form a relationship-based publisher. The company later became a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive. Gathering's first wave of releases included Railroad Tycoon II, Nocturne, Darkstone, Age of Wonders and Fly!.

Take Two acquired the company outright in May 2000, and attempted unsuccessfully to manage the Texas based group from its New York HQ. The founders and employees of G.O.D. were unhappy with the lack of freedom the company allowed for following through on its principles of fair treatment of developers and IP ownership. Founder Doug Myres died unexpectedly in May 2001, prompting the other partners to negotiate a separation with the company shortly thereafter. Eventually Take-Two took over all operations and rebranded the label simply Gathering, and have since folded it into the label 2K Games.

During the gaming trade event E3, Gathering was known for being extremely extravagant, offering free barbecue, live music, and beer to the nearly 10,000 E3 attendees that would cross the street into their ""Promised Lot"" each day; they were also famous for their Catholic Schoolgirl 'booth babes'."

Paradigm is perhaps best known for its vehicle simulation games. Founded as a 3D computer graphics company in 1990, Paradigm primarily worked on realistic flight simulation technology for major space and aviation clients. The company got its start in game development when it was contacted by Nintendo in 1994 to aid in the creation of one of the Nintendo 64's launch titles, Pilotwings 64. The game was a critical and commercial success for the developer, causing the simulation and entertainment divisions of Paradigm to separate and focus on their respective products. The newly independent Paradigm Entertainment continued to develop for Nintendo's 64-bit console. After a short partnership with Video System, Paradigm was acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary of Atari in 2000 and began developing games for sixth-generation video game consoles. Paradigm was sold to THQ in 2006 and was ultimately closed in 2008.

Their first video game was Painkiller, but many of their members had already worked on various titles before this. Some members helped create 10 different titles since 1992, with the best known being Gorky 17, or Odium in the United States. The team currently consists of 20 members, excluding external contractors.

The name ""People Can Fly"" was chosen after checking the names of several albums and song titles. On August 20, 2007, Epic Games acquired a majority share in the company. 

During an interview for Polish console games magazine Neo Plus, Adrian Chmielarz described Epic's acquisition of People Can Fly as a multi-step process. Facing issues with extending its proprietary engine, People Can Fly considered using a third-party solution. This led to an interest in the Unreal Engine, which led to contacting Epic Games. After presenting a demo to Epic Games, People Can Fly was hired to create additional content for the PC version of Gears of War. Impressed with the quality of the collaboration, Epic decided to shift the PC porting effort to the studio. The success of the Gears of War port led to the formal acquisition. 

In August 2008, Epic announced that EA would be the publisher of an action title by People Can Fly. In April 2010, it was revealed to be Bulletstorm, a first-person shooter in development with Epic Games. It was originally going to be one of the two titles revealed by Cliff Bleszinski (the other title is Gears of War 3) during his appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, but due to scheduling reasons, the announcement was cancelled."

The company was founded in 2006 by Arnt Jensen and Dino Patti. The two created the company to bring to fruition their premiere title, Limbo, a game for the Xbox Live Arcade that was released in 2010 to high critical praise.   After a year of Xbox Live exclusivity, Playdead released their ports of the game for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network, for Microsoft Windows via Steam, and Mac OS X via the Mac App Store.

Jensen, originally a developer at IO Interactive, drew sketches in 2004 that led him to the idea for Limbo. Having tried programming the game himself, he eventually sought for additional help through an art-based teaser for the game in 2006. This led to a meeting between Jensen and Patti. Patti soon realized the project was larger than the two of them, and together they founded the company, initially using their private funds and government grants before obtaining larger investments.  Playdead eventually came to have eight employees during Limbo's development, with temporary increases of up to 16 through freelancers. Limbo's success led them to be able to reacquire the company back from investors, and making Playdead fully owned by itself. 

According to Patti, as of October 2010, Playdead is currently working on its second game, which they expect to be similar in gameplay to Limbo. While Limbo was purposely made exclusive to the Xbox 360 for the first year, Playdead will consider wider distribution with this new title.   The game will utilize the Unity engine, opting for the existing solution instead of their custom-built engine they had created for Limbo, to reduce their efforts.  According to an August 2011 interview with Patti, the title's development cycle will take about three and a half years"

They have developed more than 20 games for PC and for the classic 8- and 16 bit home computer generations, including the PC action adventure Bermuda Syndrome and a cooperative-play 2D multiplayer shooter named Cyberzerk (Commodore AMIGA).

In cooperation with Pixel Park AG Berlin, they successfully designed and produced several multimedia titles in the early 90s. Their multimedia division was founded in 1993.

In 1996, the successful cooperation with Pixelpark AG ended as they were signed up by Bertelsmann.de to become an exclusive game development label for BMG interactive (a 100% daughter company of Bertelsmann which was later sold to the US publisher Take2 Interactive). The first successful game created within this cooperation was the action adventure Bermuda Syndrome (one of the very first computer games for Windows 95). Since then only two more non-game products were developed and released by Reakktor.com.

In 1997 the name of the company was changed to Reakktor.com. Their development HQ is located in Hannover, Germany and the servers for their online worlds are in a high security data center in Hamburg, Germany.

They use the latest hardware and software tools to create breathtaking computer and video games such as the massively multiplayer game Neocron (the first massively multiplayer game ever developed in Germany).

Several of these titles were also released for 16-bit platforms including the Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS and Macintosh during the late 1980s.

From the outset SSG titles were characterised by a challenging level of intelligence (AI) in the computer opponents provided in the games. Many of the games included scenario editors. For a time SSG published a tie-in magazine, Run 5, that included articles on historical background to the games, game design, game play and data for setting up new or variant scenarios. Subscribers received a disk with the scenario files already created. Published mostly quarterly it ran for 25 issues.
